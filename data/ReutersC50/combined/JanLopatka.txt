Czech consumer prices edged up less than expected in September, pleasantly surprising analysts though they remain guarded on the prospects of whether the government can hit its full-year target.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday that CPI rose 0.3 percent, month-on-month, in September after an equally unexpected 0.2 percent increase in August.
The year-on-year rate now stands 8.9 percent higher while the September sliding 12 month average inflation average was 8.7 percent, after 8.6 percent in August. A Reuters survey of economists had predicted a monthly increase of 0.6 percent.
"Our forecast for the whole year does not change, which is also given by the fact that one month result does not change much in the average inflation rate," Martin Kupka of investment bank Patria Finance told Reuters.
"I don't think that the favourable development of the last two months will repeat in the months at the end of the year, which leads to our nine percent (average) inflation forecast for the whole year, not lower," he added.
The government had originally set its average inflation rate target for the whole year at eight percent, but recently raised it to 8.3 percent.
Analysts said that 0.2 percent monthly increase in the food, tobacco and beverages sector contributed to the overall result, though they warned it could have been caused by seasonal influences.
The CSU said prices in the heavily-weighted sector were held back by a 19 percent drop in potato prices, as well as a fall in vegetable and fruit prices.
Kupka welcomed the September result, but said that when more foodstuffs from the domestic harvest come to the market toward the end of the year, prices could be pushed up as farmers look to offset rising production costs.
Radek Maly of Prague's Citibank branch said he was pleased by the September figures, as he had expected a monthly increase of 0.5 percent.
"We have to wait for what the foodstuffs prices will do in the next months...But if they keep this pace, in line with the other basket components, we could get positive figures at the end of the year," Maly said.
"The year-on-year rate could get under nine percent at the year's end if the trend continues... maybe the moving average as well."
He added that other components of the basket also showed positive development, following low increases in producer prices in the last several months.
The CSU said prices in the leisure sector dropped by 1.1 percent in the month, thanks mainly to lower prices of holiday trips abroad. Education costs rose 3.9 percent due to an increase in fees at the beginning of the new school year.
Clothing prices rose 0.9 percent, housing climbed 0.3 percent, and transportation prices remained flat in the month.
The CSU in July raised its average inflation forecast for the whole year to 9.0 percent, and the cabinet based its 1997 budget calculations on an average inflation expectation of 8.6 percent.

Czech consumer prices rose less than expected in September, but analysts said on Tuesday it remained unclear if the government can meet its full-year target.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said prices rose 0.3 percent in September versus analysts' expectations of a 0.6 percent rise.
The year-on-year inflation stood at 8.9 percent, down from 9.6 percent in August, when the monthly rise was also a low 0.2 percent. The sliding 12 month average inflation was 8.7 percent, after 8.6 percent in August.
"Our forecast for the whole year does not change, which is also because one month result does not change much in the average inflation rate," Martin Kupka of investment bank Patria Finance told Reuters.
"I don't think that the favourable developments in the last two months will be repeated in the months at the end of the year, which leads to our nine percent (average) inflation forecast for the whole year, not lower," he added.
The government had originally set its average inflation rate target for the whole year at eight percent, but recently raised it to 8.3 percent.
Analysts said that the low 0.2 percent monthly increase in the food, tobacco and beverages sector contributed to the overall result, but added this could have been caused by seasonal influences.
The CSU said prices in the heavily-weighted sector were held back by a 19 percent drop in potato prices, as well as a fall in vegetable and fruit prices.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to depreciate the currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band against which it fixes the currency daily versus a mark/dollar basket.
"I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (against the mark/dollar cross rate)," Tosovsky told reporters.
"I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band," he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is required to help the country's goods remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is l comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown "should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with."
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he had told business leaders it was necessary to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"We cannot automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items," Klaus said.
He said this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining. "We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements."

The chairman of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, told Czech President Vaclav Havel on Wednesday that his party would push for approval of a long-awaited post-war reconciliation pact, Havel's spokesman said.
Speaking after a meeting of the two officials, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told reporters that the president "thanked German Social Democrats for their interest in removing the last stones from the way of good understanding" between the two nations.
"(Lafontaine) expressed the interest of the SPD in early debate on the declaration by the governments and parliaments of the two countries," Spacek said.
Lafontaine himself told a joint news conference with the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) leader Milos Zeman that his party "was doing everything so the declaration would be approved yet this year."
The declaration seeks to address Czech memories of the 1938-1945 Nazi occupation and German memories of the indiscriminate expulsion of 2.5 million Sudetens for supporting Hitler, authorised by the victorious World War Two allies.
The Czech Republic is the only remaining victim of Nazi occupation not to have come to terms with Germany. Negotiations on the declaration have dragged on for more than a year, bedevilled by political pressures, particularly in Germany.
Prague says the text has been completed and the problem now lies with Bonn where members of the Sudeten German community, expelled en masse from the former Czechoslovakia after the war, have made a series of demands holding up the text's approval.
Havel called heads of the right-wing coalition including Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec as well as Zeman for a Thursday luncheon debate on the progress of the issue.
One obstacle seemed to disappear last month when Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the dominant figure in German politics, said he hoped it could be signed before the end of the year.
Czech government and moderate opposition leaders agree on the need to settle the issue, which Sudeten leaders have threatened to use to block Czech attempts to join the European Union.
Zeman said on Wednesday the draft version of the declaration did not include demands of Sudetens on possible double citizenship, return of property, nor cancellation of the so-called Benes decrees under which the Germans were expelled.
"I am not aware of anything like that and I don't expect it would get to the final version," he told the news conference.
Havel has said that it was wrong to hold the Sudetens collectively guilty as some -- albeit a minority -- had remained loyal to the democratic Czechoslovak state.
Spacek said Havel might give a speech to the German parliament before the year's end, but added nothing has been finalised.
Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to devalue the appreciating currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band within which it fixes the currency daily against a mark/dollar basket.
"I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (agains the mark/dollar cross rate)," Tosovsky told reporters.
"I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band," he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is still required to help the country's goods to remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is still transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is still comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is still not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating the country's inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown "should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with."
The latter was a clear reference to the European Union and especially neighbouring Germany.
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting at a government chateau east of Prague, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he also told the business leaders that it was also necessary for businesses to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"We can not automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items," Klaus said.
He said that this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining.
"We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements."

The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Thursday laid out conditions for a government scheme to buy smaller banks' doubtful debts in an effort to restore confidence in the country's banks.
The CNB said it would demand that those participating in the scheme -- which is open to a total of 13 small, private, banks -- follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed.
CNB officials said the programme, approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank.
"It is a preventative programme, it is a step toward strenghtening the confidence in our banking sector," CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky said.
He said the decision followed the failure of Keditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the "politicisation" of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks.
The collapse became a political issue which drove parliament to set up an inquiry.
The plan will be open to all small private banks which have total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million), each with total assets not more than 30 billion crowns.
The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at a nominal price.
The banks will be required to buy back the assets after "around five to seven years", again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime, CNB board member Ota Kaftan said.
He said banks seeking to participate would be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio.
Kaftan said that the banks must maintain cost controls, profitability, and liquidity as well as agree to frequent reviews by the central bank.
The maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated.
The programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal banks which elect to participate in the scheme.
The banks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka,  Evrobanka,  Prvni Mestska Banka,  COOP Banka,  Pragobanka,  Plzenska Banka,  Foresbank,  Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka,  Universal Banka,  Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana.
Tosovsky said the money for the scheme would come primarily from state-controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme.
Any losses from the programme would be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency.
Analysts welcomed the programme as long as it leads to better risk management at the smaller banks, which still comprise a minor fraction of activity. But overall, they said, it was a political step taken under pressure. ($1=27.26 Czech Crown)
Bitter infighting broke out among Czech Social Democrats on Friday only a month before elections in which the opposition party hopes to humiliate conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Party chairman Milos Zeman denied there was any split in his party, which is running neck and neck with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) before Senate elections next month.
But almost in the same breath he threatened to resign next spring unless a party deputy chairman who broke ranks to vote with the Klaus government last week went first.
Adding to his woes, a Social Democrat deputy threatened to leave the parliamentary party in a row with an ex-communist colleague, a move which could tip the balance of parliamentary power between the minority government and opposition.
Klaus, whose three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority in lower house elections earlier this year, has seemed under heavy pressure with opinion polls showing the Social Democrats level or slightly ahead of his ODS.
But just as the Social Democrats seemed in with a good chance of beating the ODS for the first time since the restoration of democracy, strife flared in opposition ranks.
Last week Jozef Wagner, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, led a revolt by four Social Democrat deputies which allowed the 1997 state budget to pass its first reading.
Tempers flared on Friday after Wagner threatened to resign from the parliamentary party unless another Social Democrat deputy, ex-communist Michal Kraus, quit the budget committee and a parliamentary commission investigating a bank collapse.
Despite the appearance of disarray in Social Democrat ranks, Zeman played down Wagner's threat. "There is no real split. I do not want to overestimate the importance of his proclamation in this case," he told a news conference.
"A split would happen only if a body of opinion formed which was sharply different in questions of principle from the opinion of the party leadership," he said.
But then he attacked party deputy chairman Karel Machovec, one of the Wagner rebels. "There should not be a person in the leadership who shows himself up by talking about disputes in the party," said Zeman.
Asked if he would resign if Machovec remained vice chairman after a party congress scheduled for next March, Zeman said: "Yes. It is true, I can confirm that."
Kraus, a communist deputy before the 1989 collapse of the East Bloc, accused the four budget rebels of being "corrupted politically" by the Klaus coalition.
Wagner told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes he would leave the Social Democratic parliamentary party or "club" if Kraus did not go. Machovec was quoted by local media as saying that if Wagner left, there would be a serious party split.
This could change the balance of power in the 200-seat lower house where the Social Democrats, along with the little-reformed Communists and the far-right Republicans, have 101 votes to the government's 99.
The Senate itself has few powers. But the elections on November 15 and 16, with a second round runoff a week later, have become a test of public opinion which could indicate whether early lower house elections are likely.
Analysts say that if the Social Democrats perform strongly, Zeman might be tempted to bring down the coalition to force lower house polls in which his party might overtake Klaus's ODS. But that depends on Zeman being able to maintain discipline.
So far voters do not seem concerned. A poll taken by the STEM agency before and after the budget vote showed the Social Democrats with 27.3 percent support ahead of ODS with 26.8.
In the lower house elections on May 31-June 1, ODS won 29.6 percent and the Social Democrats 26.4.
The Czech cabinet should decide soon on the further privatisation of the largest savings bank, Ceska Sporitelna a.s. to clarify the situation for potential investors, a bank official said on Thursday.
Sporitelna's deputy general director Jaroslav Svoboda said however there was not a need to hurry with the privatisation, and that he believed that the state should keep a 10 to 15 percent stake in the bank after sale is concluded.
"The important thing is to decide on the privatisation in order to calm down the situation, also for foreign investors (so they know) how to proceed on the Czech market," Svoboda told reporters.
"I think it is not necessary to hurry abnormally with the privatisation (after the decision)," he added.
Sporitelna's further privatisation has become a hot topic in Czech banking circles especially after the central bank's recent suggestion to merge the bank with Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (CSOB), one of the country's four largest banks.
The state currently holds 45 percent stake in the bank through its privatisation agency, the National Property Fund (NPF). Svoboda said 30 to 35 percent should be sold to one, or possibly two, "long-term and transparent" investors.
"If it was a domestic investor, there is the question where it would get money for it. A foreign investor could use capital not obtained on the domestic market," Svoboda said.
Asked about the Czech National Bank's (CNB) proposal to merge Sporitelna with CSOB, Svoboda said that he had not seen the plans, and he had little reaction to what had been reported in the media.
He said however that Sporitelna has developed its specific position on the Czech market over many years and that should be preserved.
The CNB plan submitted to the cabinet calls for a merger of the two institutions which would create the largest banking institution in the Eastern Europe with combined assets of roughly 540 billion crowns.
The CNB however proposed holding off on privatisation of the new combined Sporitelna and CSOB for three to five years until the effects of the merger were analysed.
The plan also calls for fast selloff of the state 31.5 percent stake in another bank, IPB a.s. , to a foreign partner, and for a delay in the privatisation of the state roughly 49 percent share in Komercni Banka a.s. .
It is not clear when the cabinet will debate the CNB proposals, but a senior central bank official said it might be on the agenda of next Wednesday's government meeting.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Tuesday said the 1997 Czech state budget, to be presented to the full cabinet in September, plans an overall spending increase of 11.8 percent.
Speaking to reporters after a working session of economics ministers, Klaus also said he did not expect inflation to fall below eight percent next year.
The monetarist economist Klaus, who has said a balanced budget is the "Alpha and Omega" of his government, said spending increases would be largest in percentage terms for export supports, regional transportation, and housing.
He said the total expenditure side next year would rise 58 billion czech crowns ($2.21 billion) over expected 1996 spending to 549 billion crowns. The ministers were to discuss the revenue side of the budget later in September.
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said the full cabinet should get the full draft for discussion on September 20. When asked if there was talk among ministers of anything excpet a balanced budget Kocarnik replied tersely "No".
The government's draft budget has traditionally been debated and passed by mid-December.
Klaus's government has passed four straight balanced budgets, although it will discuss a plan on Wednesday to cut 1996 spending by another 9.3 billion crowns in order to balance this year's ledger.
Klaus said the expenditure figures were still subject to further discussion but he did not expect major changes. Fixed manadatory expenditures are forecast rising by 14.0 percent while discressionary spending would rise 9.9 percent.
Klaus added that state sector wages were planned to rise a nominal 12.4 percent in 1997, and he hoped that it would set an example for private sector budget planning.
"(The government) wants to send a message which would lead to a certain stoppage of the pace of wage increases also in the non-budget (private sector) sphere," Klaus said.
Earlier this month the central bank warned of inflationary wage rises not being matched by increases in productivity.
Klaus also said that he did not expect 1997 inflation to fall below eight percent, which was the government's target for lowering inflation in 1996.
"Unfortunately we don't expect a number lower than eight (percent)," he said.
He did not elaborate on if he meant average or year-on-year inflation. For budget purposes, however, the government usually speaks in terms of average inflation.
Czech year-on-year inflation stood at 9.4 percent in July, while the moving average stood at 8.6 percent.
The government in passing the 1996 budget forecast inflation for the year of roughly eight percent, but strong domestic demand has kept prices higher.

The largest Czech commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s. , on Friday posted roughly 10 percent lower nine-month results but attributed the drop to accounting changes and KB's shares rose on the news.
The bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.
The bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its methodolgy to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions, including penalty payments.
"Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is by roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But, there is very important methodical influence," Ziegler told reporters.
"Currently there are only really paid late fees in our books, that means real cash flow."
He added that the sum of unpaid late fees substracted from the accounting was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.
The bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.
The net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.
Under Czech accounting standards, which Ziegler said do not include the tital of 700 million crowns of unrealised gains from securities, Komercni's gross for the period was 3.87 billion, down from 6.83 billion year on year.
He told rpeorters that he considered the results to be "very good", but warned that simple annualisation of the nine month figures would not lead to a full-year profit forecast.
He said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors.
Sandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures,
"The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out 1996 forecast."
He added that the forecast was a 5.95 billion crown net profit, according to international standards.
Komercni share price jumped 125 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to 2,125, and closed at 2,126 after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results.
Dealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors.
"Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock," he said.
Added Chen: "We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity."
Komercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a 48.74 percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a 9.65 percent stake.

The largest Czech commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s., said on Friday that profits in the first nine months of this year fell some 10 percent due to accounting changes. The shares rose on the news.
The bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.
The bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its accounting method to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions.
"Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences," Ziegler told reporters.
Only those fees that have actually been paid are included in the figures now whereas outstanding receivables were included previously, he said.
He added that the amount of late fees that would have been included under the previous accounting method was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.
The bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.
The net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, in his dual role as economics professor, said on Monday the large Czech foreign trade deficit came from a temporary investment wave, and he forecast a perpetual, but smaller trade gap.
Lecturing a packed assembly hall at the Prague School of Economics, Klaus, a freshly-accredited professor of economics, said the record 110.7 billion crown trade deficit in the first nine months of this year was "not tragic".
"It would be correct to discuss the current account, or the whole payment balance, and not just the trade balance... due to a number of structural phenomena," Klaus said.
"The Czech Republic will probably not have a positive trade balance in the long term, ever," he added.
Klaus said the current trade deficit was "the temporary above-average rate of investment."
He said the investment boom would ease, leading to a narrowing in the differential with savings, but a lack of natural resources, the structure of the Czech economy, and its geographical position would perpetuate a trade deficit.
In the first nine months of this year, imports rose by a nominal 15.2 percent, year-on-year, to 551.2 billion crowns, while exports climbed 5.9 percent to 440.5 percent.
The Czech Statistical Bureau forecast last week that the foreign trade deficit would reach 163.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from about 95.7 billion crowns last year.
The current account deficit stood at 46.7 billion crowns, or 6.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half, and the CSU foreacsts it to reach 6.9 percent of GDP for the whole of 1996, and 6.8-7.4 percent of GDP next year.
Klaus repeated his long-held objection to a devaluation of the Czech crown, saying it would not help much as exports "are not a straight function of the exchange rate".
He also criticised export lobbyists' calls for an import surcharge and higher tariffs, and blasted moves to "Buy Czech", saying each country should use its comparative advantages in production and cannot make everything itself.
But Klaus, tongue-in-cheek, checked the bottle of mineral water he was given, and was pleased it was locally made.
"I was going to complain that you gave me imported water," he told the rector of the university, sitting by his side.
He said his government's aim was to stop an acceleration in the deficit, and then to start lowering it. He said the increase could be stopped by the beginning of 1998.
There is no theory on what is the maximum-bearable deficit of the current account, as a percentage of GDP, Klaus said.
He said that the Czech Republic had more than sufficient foreign exchange reserves cover the gap. The Czech central bank said official reserves totalled roughly $13 billion at the end of August, with gross banking-sector reserves at $16.6 billion.
Answering a student's question on export structure, Klaus said that exports high-added-value goods would help the overall trade balance, but such technology would take time to develop.
"How high can you jump? One metre thirty? It would be better if you could jump one-eighty.... But you can't do that straight away, you need to train it," Klaus said.
With practise "maybe you'll get to some 140 centimetres in a year's time," he said.

Lecturing a packed assembly hall at the Prague School of Economics, Klaus, a freshly-accredited professor of economics, said the record 110.7 billion crown trade deficit in the first nine months of this year was "not tragic".
"It would be correct to discuss the current account, or the whole payment balance, and not just the trade balance... due to a number of structural phenomena," Klaus said.
"The Czech Republic will probably not have a positive trade balance in the long term, ever," he added.
Klaus said the current trade deficit was "the temporary above-average rate of investment."
He said the investment boom would ease, leading to a narrowing in the differential with savings, but a lack of natural resources, the structure of the Czech economy, and its geographical position would perpetuate a trade deficit.
In the first nine months of this year, imports rose by a nominal 15.2 percent, year-on-year, to 551.2 billion crowns, while exports climbed 5.9 percent to 440.5 percent.
The Czech Statistical Bureau forecast last week that the foreign trade deficit would reach 163.3 billion crowns for the whole of 1996, up from about 95.7 billion crowns last year.
The current account deficit stood at 46.7 billion crowns, or 6.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half, and the CSU foreacsts it to reach 6.9 percent of GDP for the whole of 1996, and 6.8-7.4 percent of GDP next year.
Klaus repeated his long-held objection to a devaluation of the Czech crown, saying it would not help much as exports "are not a straight function of the exchange rate".
He also criticised export lobbyists' calls for an import surcharge and higher tariffs, and blasted moves to "Buy Czech", saying each country should use its comparative advantages in production and cannot make everything itself.
Klaus said his government's aim was to stop an acceleration in the deficit, and then to start lowering it. He said the increase could be stopped by the beginning of 1998.
There is no theory on what is the maximum-bearable deficit of the current account, as a percentage of GDP, Klaus said.
He said that the Czech Republic had more than sufficient foreign exchange reserves cover the gap. The Czech central bank said official reserves totalled roughly $13 billion at the end of August, with gross banking-sector reserves at $16.6 billion.
Answering a student's question on export structure, Klaus said that exports of high-added-value goods would help the overall trade balance, but such technology would take time to develop.
"How high can you jump? One metre thirty? It would be better if you could jump one-eighty.... But you can't do that straight away, you need to train it," Klaus said.
With practise "maybe you'll get to some 140 centimetres in a year's time," he said.

Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced a state commission on Wednesday to attack bureaucracy in the land of Franz Kafka.
It will have a steering committee, a chairman, two vice-chairmen, two sections, six sub-commissions and more members than the Klaus's cabinet.
But Klaus denied suggestions that the new "Commission for the Removal of Bureaucratic Burden" would pour fuel on to the fire, telling a news conference that the only bureaucrat working at the commission would be a secretary. 
The other staff, numbering around 20, would perform their duties part time, said Klaus, whose cabinet has 16 members.
The Czech bureaucracy, crafted by the Austro-Hungarian empire and perfected under communism, inflicts daily misery on local and foreign residents alike.
Franz Kafka, the Prague novellist of the early 20th century, wrote of angst born of bureaucracy in such works as "The Trial" and "The Castle".
Things today do not seem much better. Applications for documents such as company registrations, licences and work permits can take weeks or months to process.
They can involve repeated visits to offices where citizens have to queue patiently sometimes for hours waiting to be summoned by often surly bureaucrats. Knocking on office doors for attention is strictly forbidden.
Klaus said the commission should aim to simplify issues like setting up a business, getting construction permits or social benefits, or dealing with tax offices.
Chairman Vladimir Budinsky, a former transport minister, indicated he was confident his commission would not gain the Czech bureaucrat's reputation for idleness.
"I believe that we will be able to find people for each section who would be ready to work," he said.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said on Friday that there was no need to hurry the of the state's stake in the country's largest commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s..
He said when the time comes to sell the stake of some 49 percent it could be offered to several investors.
"There is not a need to hurry with (Komercni's) privatisation. A strategic partner is not necessary, so it is possible to propose to sell the state stake to more investors," Tosovsky said after a closed meeting of the parliament's banking commission.
But he added the central bank does not yet have a strong consensus on what to do with the stake.
"We haven't an absolutely firm opinion on this, it's possible (to sell) to both domestic and foreign investors."
The central bank has submitted a broad plan to privatise shares in the so-called "Big Four" banks which calls for the merger of trade bank  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. with Ceska Sporitlena a.s., the largest savings bank.
The CNB has said it would prefer to wait several years before privatising the state shares after the newly-merged bank is established to analyse effects of the merger.
"CSOB is ready for quite a fast privatisation, but when considered in a wider scope, we (the CNB) think that a merger with Ceska Sporitelna would be more suitable," Tosovsky said.
"If this proposal is accepted, privatisation would be... delayed, beause there must be the merger first."
The Czech cabinet must approve any privatisation of shares in the Big Four banks, and this week they asked the central bank for more concrete details on the central bank's plan.
"(A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna) has a number of rational and economic reasons," Tosovsky said without elaborating.
The governor rejected comments by CSOB and Sporitelna executives who reacted coolly to the merger plan.
"The managements are not the owners... it's logical the managements have their own interests and preferences, but the owner is the (state National Property Fund)," he said.
He said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had requested details to the central bank's plan for a quick sale of the state's 31.5 percent of Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. to a strategic foreign partner.
"The prime minister proposed (for the CNB) to make concrete some procedings concerning mostly IPB so that the privatisation can start as soon as possible," Tosovsky said.
IPB executives have confirmed that both Japan's Nomura and Dutch ING Bank NV have shown an interest in acquiring shares in IPB.
Klaus has said he is not in favour of the CSOB/Sporitelna merger, equating it with melding Prague's two top soccer teams Sparta and Slavia, an idea unthinkable for most Czechs.

The Czech government faces one of its most difficult decisions in choosing how to diversify natural gas supplies now coming solely from Russia, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday.
"It is going to be one of the toughest decisions of this cabinet," ministry spokesman Miroslav Konvalina quoted Dlouhy as telling Anneke van Dok-van Weele, the visiting Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade.
Dlouhy has said he would submit four options for securing gas supplies in the future, but declined to detail them before the material is debated by the ministers. He has said that Russia would remain the dominant supplier.
But a source at his ministry, who asked not to be named, confirmed on Thursday a story in the Czech weekly Tyden which listed the four options:
* Purchasing all natural gas from Gazprom, using two different shipping routes, with a long-term agreement until 2,016, with price guarantees until 1998.
* Purchasing some Russian gas indirectly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany' Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF.
Gasunie would start supplies in 1998, delivering up to two billion cubic metres in 2005, with agreement lasting until 2014. In case of fallout of Russian supplies, it would deliver its own natural gas through Wingas, a joint venture of Wintershall (65 percent) and Gazprom (35 percent).
Wintershall offers a similar scheme, with deliveries starting on January 1 next year, rising to one billion cubic metres in 2000, under a deal until 2016.
Negotiations with these firms are in the stage of initiating an supply contract.
* Finalising and maintaining the agreement for Norwegian gas, which has already been preliminarily approved this year, until 2017.
* A limited purchase from U.S.-based Mobil Europe Gas Inc., Germany's Brigitta Erdgas und Erdoel (BEB), and British Gas plc.
"But we do not want to connect this decision with political issues like our relations with the European Union or NATO."
The Czechs have ended their dependance on Russian crude oil by building a new pipeline to Germany, but are still completely dependant on supplies provided by Russia's Gazprom.
The senior official from Dlouhy's ministry told Reuters that the issue would most probably be debated by the council of ministers, which should come up with a recommendation to the full cabinet, "in the coming days, probably next week".
Government representatives have held talks on limited deliveries from Norway, which according to a preliminary agreement should start in January next year.
The Czechs consume around eight to nine billion cubic metres of natural gas per year, but volume is expected to rise to some 12-13 billion cubic metres by the turn of the century.
The preliminary agreement, which was initiated by Czech state-owned importer Transgas with Norway's GFU gas negotiating alliance in summer, expects eventual growing of the potential supplies to three billion cubic metres per year in 2002.
Konvalina said Dlouhy told Minister van Dok-van Weele that one option included involvement of Dutch companies in future supplies, and the minister said her country could provide "confidence and reliablity guarantees" for the supplies.
The spokesman, who declined direct comment on the four options presented to the government, said Dlouhy told the Dutch minister the Czech "priority is to diversify, but we will keep a balanced relations with the Russian side at the same time".

Czech President Vaclav Havel on Tuesday called the opposition Social Democrat leader "extremely irresponsible" for claiming the secret service was being used for party politics.
Havel's remarks came as campaigning for closely-fought Senate elections due this weekend turned increasingly bitter, with the secret service in the middle.
Earlier Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus accused Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman of lying when he made a thinly-veiled allegation that the BIS intelligence agency had tried to extract compromising material from his elderly mother.
The slanging match between the two leading antagonists of Czech politics began on Monday when BIS director Stanislav Devaty, a Klaus protege, was forced to quit over allegations of spying on a deputy premier and a subsequent coverup.
"Yesterday's comments by Zeman on a police state, or on the BIS as a political police in the service of one party, are a visible result of losing his nerve before the elections," Klaus told a news conference on Tuesday.
"I can imagine such words being said by a radical anarchist but I can't imagine them from one of the three highest constitutional officials of this country."
On Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with Klaus's ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
"During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians," said Zeman.
Havel, who is politically neutral, said after talks with Interior Minister Jan Ruml:  "I can only say that I consider (Zeman's) statements to be extremely irresponsible."
"As chairman of the parliament he should know that it is necessary to proceed in the proper ways," Havel said at his private residence in the Hradecek region of east Bohemia.
He said Zeman should have first brought the charges to a parliamentary commission overseeing the intelligence services before making them public.
But the president added that he would meet Zeman, who promised to produce evidence backing the claims next week.
Havel, imprisoned on several occasions as a political dissident under communism, said he "could not be the head of a state which would create a system for spying on its politicians".
He said rogue individuals or groups within the BIS might attempt such actions, but without the approval of superiors.
Spymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, junior partners in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago and then covering up the operation.
Allegations of politically-inspired spying have surfaced in recent years in a country where memories of the pervasive state security apparatus during four decades of communism still linger.
Klaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, but on his former adviser, director of a bank which collapsed amid fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.

On Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
"The political struggle should be a struggle of arguments and not an abuse of secret services for spying on political opponents," he said.
"During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians," said Zeman.
Spymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the junior Christian Democrats in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago.
The BIS had covered up the operation by failing to report it to the cabinet and a parliamentary commission supervising the agency.
Klaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, who is also agriculture minister, but on a former adviser of his who was director of a bank which collapsed amidst fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the state security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.
Devaty was a member of Klaus's ODS, although he had suspended his membership to become BIS chief.
Allegations of politically-inspired spying on both government and opposition politicians have surfaced regularly in recent years in a country where memories remain of the pervasive state security apparatus before communism fell in 1989.
The political temperature soared on Tuesday when Zeman said his 79-year-old mother had been visited by "certain people" trying to acquire compromising information.
Asked about this comment, Klaus said: "If this actually represents what he said then this is such an unbelievable lie that I couldn't bring myself to reply at all. It's pure lie."
Klaus accused Zeman of running a negative campaign.
"Instead of programmes there are scandals and affairs which destabilise the state and damage our country abroad," he said.
"The BIS affair is a clear evidence that above all the (Social Democrats) lack, in contrast to the ODS, a positive programme."
The three-party Czech coalition cabinet on Wednesday agreed to quickly find a new director for the country's secret service following the resignation of its former chief amid a pre-election political spying row.
Prime Minster Vaclav Klaus, head of the senior coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference that each coalition party had been asked to propose a candidate acceptable for all parties to lead the BIS "as soon as possible".
Acting-director Stanislav Devaty resigned on Monday after the head of junior coalition partner, Christian Democratic Union (KDU-CSL) Josef Lux accused the BIS last Friday of spying on him three years ago and then covering it up.
He requested Devaty's dismissal along with the right-wing Civic Demopcratic Alliance (ODA), the other coalition member which had already made similar claims last year.
The government charged Devaty's deputy, Jaroslav Jiru, to lead the BIS until a new director is named, Klaus said.
The affair hotted up just a week before Senate elections, a key test of Klaus's government which lost its majority in the lower house of parliament in June elections.
The Senate has only limited powers but analysts say the outcome of the polls will be a significant indicator for the future of Klaus's centre-right cabinet. The allegations within the coalition were potentially damaging ahead of the vote.
Klaus said the ministers were also asked to consider how to tighten control over BIS.
Analysts say if Klaus's party fares well in the elections, his government's position may be eased. But he might find it hard to stay in office if his position is weak in both houses.
Klaus said ministers were disturbed by opposition Social Democrat chairman of parliament Milos Zeman who had suggested the Interior Ministry had joined the BIS in creating "political police" groups shadowing politicians.
"All members of the cabinet expressed their irritation from the statements of the second constitutional official of this country, by which he in fact threw in doubt the credibility of the constitution system of the Czech Republic," Klaus said.
President Vaclav Havel has called Zeman's statements "extremely irresponsible" and said the opposition leader should go through formal channels he has proof of his accusations.
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Wednesday that there was no reason to hurry the privatisation of the country's four largest banks.
"(The privatisation) does not have any exceptional level of urgency," Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
He said the cabinet would wait until the central bank submitted a more complete plan to the cabinet for the privatisation of the remaining state shares in the large banks.
"It is irrelevant if it is two or three weeks later or two or three weeks sooner," Klaus said.
The central bank and the finance ministry have both called for the rapid privatisation of the state's roughly one-third stake in Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. to a strategic foreign partner.
Japan-based investment bank Nomura and Dutch ING Bank NV are both said to have a strong interest in the IPB stake.
The Czech National Bank, the central bank, also has called for the merger of the largest savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s., with the foreign trade bank Ceskovslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s..
If the merger goes ahead, forming a bank with 540 billion crowns ($20.16 billion) in assets based on end-1995 results, the plan would be to privatise the new megabank several years later.
Klaus has balked at the merger plan, saying that it was akin to merging Prague's two top soccer clubs, Sparta and Slavia, which would be hard for Czechs to imagine.
The prime minister has reacted favourably in recent weeks to news that Nomura was keen to buy the state's stake in IPB.
At the news conference Klaus bristled at a series of questions on the subject by foreign news agencies. When asked specifically about the timing of IPB's privatisation Klaus said: "I don't know if this is the question of some lobbyist who wants to buy some bank fast, or really the general interest of a journalist."
"From the point of view of the first (case)," he continued, "then I think that a party interested in buying or who instigates you into this question is probably in a hurry."

Czech President Vaclav Havel, nursing a heavy cold, voted in Senate elections on Friday and called on fellow citizens to turn out despite widespread apathy or even hostility towards the newly created upper house.
Voting in a Prague suburb, Havel showed his identity card to election officials before patiently queueing up with pensioners to cast his ballot in a primary school.
The vote is the first electoral test for right-wing Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus since he lost his lower house majority in June.
Opinion polls suggest many Czechs will not bother to turn out for the elections, which have a second round runoff on November 22 and 23, because they either do not understand what the Senate will do or feel it is a waste of time.
The Senate was written into the new constitution of the Czech Republic which came into force in 1993 after the breakup of Czechoslovakia. But only now is the Senate to be elected after much political footdragging.
Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails in the fight to restore Czech democracy, called on citizens to vote even it means turning out two weekends in a row.
"At first glance it may seem like bothering people that they have to vote twice in a row," he said in a voice made hoarse by his illness.
But he pointed out that the two-round system, in which the top two candidates from the first round meet in a runoff if neither wins more than half the vote, was common in Europe.
"It has to be like that and I believe that anyone who is not indifferent to the democratic development of our country will turn out for the second round as well," he said.
Both rounds span a Friday and Saturday, with voting ending at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT).
Havel has appealed for a high turnout before previous elections. Until now Czechs, who regained their pre-war democracy after the 1989 fall of communism, have heeded him.
Turnout was 76.4 percent in voting for the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last June. But it is expected to be much lower for the Senate, which has few powers compared with the Chamber of Deputies where all government and opposition leaders sit.
A survey by the IVVM agency showed that only 57 percent planned to vote in the first round and 52 in the runoffs. Another IVVM poll showed 53 percent of those questioned doubted the need for the Senate at all.
Politicians have also been lukewarm. However, the results may give clues on the political way ahead, depending on how well Civic Democratic Party (ODS) headed by Klaus and its two junior coalition partners do.
If the coalition performs well, Klaus may be tempted to provoke early lower house elections in an attempt to regain the majority lost in a surge in support for the opposition Social Democrats.
But if the Social Democrats win the Senate race, Klaus could be forced to resign.
Most opinion polls suggest a tight race. But the last survey suggested the ODS was pulling ahead after an outbreak of squabbling in Social Democrat ranks.
The Social Democrats may also have suffered from a row this week over allegations by their chairman Milos Zeman that the state intelligence agency BIS had spied on him.
Asked about the row, Havel told reporters: "I don't think that the affair, as you call it, will influence in any significant way the outcome of the elections."
Czech power producer CEZ a.s. on Friday said its nine month net profit hit 8.4 billion crowns ($312.6 million), up from 7.4 billion for the same period last year, according to international accounting standards, after household electricity demand surged.
CEZ's Director of Planning and Analysis section Petr Voboril told a news conference that higher depreciation write-offs due to the opening of new installations cut the company's tax obligations, and boosting its bottom line.
The company's gross profit for the period remained flat at 13.1 billion.
Czech accounting put the firm's profit for the first nine months at 7.04 billion, up from 6.7 billion last year.
CEZ said the result did not change the firm's profit forecast under Czech standards for the whole year, which is 8.1 billion crowns, equal to last year's.
A financial statement showed CEZ wrote off 4.1 billion in the first nine months compared with 3.4 billion in the same period of 1995, and paid 4.7 billion in income tax after 5.7 billion last year.
"Above all, lowering of tax obligations in connection with depriciation policy have influenced this (profit) increase," Voboril said.
He said that overall demand for electricity rose by 5.5 percent in the period, and is expected to reach a record high of 55.3 terrawatthours, 6.1 percent up year-on-year, for the whole 1996.
Household consumption drove the increase, rising 10.5 percent, while large clients demanded almost two percent more power over the same period of the last year.
Voboril said that a recent ruling by the Finance Minstry on maximum prices CEZ can charge regional power distributors did not effect results thanks to the sales increase.
The ministry decided that the maximum average price CEZ can charge for supplies this year is 1,035 crowns per megawatthour, up two crowns from the last year but below the firm's 1,040 crown expectation included in business plan.
Voboril said that short-term indebtedness of CEZ increased as well as financial expenditures due to unpaid debts from some of the eight regional distributors, which totalled 3.2 billion crowns as of September 30.
CEZ and six of the country's eight regional grid operators had been locked in a price dispute with CEZ until the ministry ruling last month.
CEZ is also considering an international bond issue next year as it needs financing but has already flooded the domestic market with paper, Voboril said.
Local analysts welcomed the results but said they did not expect them to help CEZ's share price much as the Prague Stock Exchange is plagued by a lack of confidence.
"The CEZ results are slightly better than I expected. CEZ is fundamentally undervalued but genereal market sentiment is not very strong," said Petr Dousa of Zivnostenska Banka. "I don't expect the price to go up to 1,000 in the next few days."

The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus performed strongly in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats trailing on 20.27 percent.
The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance.
"It is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability," he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate since the inconclusive lower house polls.
"These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal," he said.
Klaus also sidestepped questions on whether he might seek early lower house elections to try to regain his majority.
But analysts said the results may be misleading. Unlike the lower house system of proportional representation, the Senate is elected in two rounds of a first-past-the-post system.
Only three ODS candidates won outright in the first round held on Friday and Saturday. Another 76 face a run-off on November 22-23 between the top two contenders in constitiuencies where no-one won more than half the first round vote.
Also, the well-organised and funded ODS is better at rallying support when public interest in elections is low than the Social Democrats. Klaus cannot therefore automatically rely on repeating the performance in a lower house election, when turnout is usually over 75 percent.
But the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections to the newly-created upper house and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
The Central Election Commission said turnout was just 35.03 percent, far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections in June.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: "I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates."
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. "They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate," he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.
The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus pulled ahead in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at just 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of Klaus's minority coalition government, candidates of his centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) topped voting in 66 of the 71 constituencies declared by mid-evening.
But most face a second round run-off on November 22-23 for the newly-created upper house, and analysts said the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
Nationwide figures were not available. But the Central Election Commission said turnout in 53 of the 81 constituencies had been just 34.27 percent.
This was far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections held in June.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance following his electoral disaster last June, when strong Social Democrat gains stripped his three-party coalition of its lower house majority.
"From the results so far it is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability," he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate which has stalled reform since the inconclusive lower house polls.
"These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal," he said.
Under the Senate rules, candidates who fail to win over half the first round vote have to face the runner-up in a second round. Most constituencies will be decided next weekend.
But already it appears the Social Democrats of economist Milos Zeman have done badly, failing to come out on top in a single constituency.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: "I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates."

Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate, Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority, although he denies that.
But ODS is better at mobilising support than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.
"If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country," said Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI).
Disgruntled Czech opposition Social Democrats have blamed party chairman Milos Zeman for their poor showing in weekend elections for the country's new Senate.
They suggested that charges by Zeman ahead of the elections that intelligence agents had harassed himself and his mother had backfired on the party, which had been neck and neck with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
In the event, the Social democrats won only 20.3 percent of the vote in first round voting held on Friday and Saturday. This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
While the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.
Vasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.
"The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters," the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.
Shortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.
Earlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.
The Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.
Low turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.
Only 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.
The Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.
Afterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.
Zeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.
"When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote," he said.
One Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.
Wagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.
Wagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.
The "Big Four" state-controlled Czech banks need owners who could secure their growth and international competitivness, a vice-governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Pavel Kysilka, said on Wednesday.
"We need strong, stable, sound and efficient banks able to compete on the European market," Kysilka told a banking seminar. "Czech banks need owners who can meet that criteria."
He said the CNB had fine-tuned its concept, submitted to the government last month, for selling the state's stakes in the country's four largest banks, after requests for clarification from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Kysilka did not elaborate on what changes were made to the CNB's original concept.
The state holds 49 percent in Komercni Banka a.s., 45 percent in savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s., 66 percent in Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB), and 31.5 percent in IPB a.s..
The parts of the original CNB plan which have already been been made public propose a quick selloff of the IPB stake, a merger of CSOB and Sporitelna with eventual privatisation of the single entity, and an incremental sale of Komercni shares.
The ultimate decision rests with the government which has yet to put forward its own plan. The CNB has said however that there is a broad consensus that the "Big Four" privatisations should go through, but the question is how.
Klaus has said he was opposed to the idea of a merger of CSOB and Sporitelna, which would create post-Communist Europe's largest bank with assets topping $20 billion
But Klaus and the Finance Ministry have agreed that the IPB stake should be sold quickly to a strategic foreign investor.
Local media have been ripe with speculation over which foreign partner is most likely to take the shares.
Japan-based Nomura, and Dutch ING Bank NV, are widely seen as front runners for the IPB stake.
The Czech private station TV Nova reported earlier this week that Dutch bank ABN Amro was also interested in buying into IPB.
On Wednesday, an ABN Amro spokesman said his bank viewed the report as "market rumour" and declined further comment.
Meanwhile, Klaus economic adviser Martin Kocourek was quoted as saying in the Czech daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday that Union Bank of Switzerland  was looking to win a mandate to arrange the sale of IPB's stake.
CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky told Reuters last week however that the full cabinet had yet to discuss the central bank's plan but would do so in a few weeks time. He said only a few of the opinions from the government were known.
Kysilka told the confernce that the state-held stakes in the Big Four are now worth 50-60 billion crowns at market prices, after having negative value before the post-Communist banking reforms at the beginning of the 1990's.

Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on Wednesday said the government had approved a plan to privatise at least part of the state's 31.5 percent stake in commercial bank IPB a.s..
Speaking after the government's regular weekly session, Klaus said he had charged Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik with the task of setting conditions for a tender to sell the stake.
He added that no decision on a central bank proposal to merge banks CSOB a.s. and Ceska Sporitelna a.s. had been taken, though the government remained committed to privatising its holdings in the country's four biggest banks.
"He (Kocarnik) is due to submit to the cabinet, in cooperation with a chosen consultancy firm, the criteria for the selection of a strategic foreign partner," Klaus said.
Representatives from the state privatisation agency, the National Property Fund (NPF), and the central bank would also be involved in the process of developing the tender.
"The intention is for Mr Kocarnik to come up with the criteria as soon as possible," Klaus said.
Klaus did not say how much of the government's stake would be included in the sale to a strategic foreign partner.
Japan's Nomura and Dutch banks ING and ABN AMRO have been widely reported as expressing an interest in the IPB stake.
The central bank has submitted a plan to the cabinet proposing a merger of CSOB, where the Czech government holds 66 percent, and Ceska Sporitelna where it has 45 percent, but Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has reacted coolly to the idea.
"We did not make any fundamental judgements on mergers today," Klaus said. He did not elaborate.
A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna would create post-Communist Europe's largest bank with assets topping $20 billion.
Klaus added that the privatisation of CSOB, which is wholly-owned by Czech and Slovak state institutions, and the selloff of Komercni Banka were complicated because of shareholdings and arrangements between the banks and Slovakia.
The Czech Statistical Bureau
(CSU) said on Thursday it would change its methodology for
calculating industrial production, to bring it in line with
western standards.
CSU Chairman Edvard Outrata said the change, which updates
the old methodology introduced in 1953 under communist
planning, would take effect in January 1997.
The new methodology excludes multiple calculation of
semi-finished products, resources, and other materials and
commodities, which were included in output data at every stage
under the old method measuring the gross value of all goods
produced, the CSU said.
The new index will measure output changes by units, weight
or other measurements, of the total of 1,304 products out of
879 product groups consisting of one or more similar products.
The product groups's output indices will be placed in
sectors, using weighting equal to their weight in the
respective industrial sector.
The overall index will be calculated from weighted changes
in the sectoral indices.
Outrata said the old system of measuring "gross
production", or "goods production" was suited for the
management of a planned economy as it allowed to measure the
total summ of production and compare it with state plans.
Construction output data will be adjusted to the new
methodology at the beginning of 1998, Outrata added.
Preliminary monthly data will be released on the 40th day
after the end of the month being examined.
Outrata also said the data would include seasonally
adjusted and figures adjusted if the number of working days in
the period differed from previously measured periods.
He added the CSU would gradually, throughout next year,
start releasing seasonally adjusted and pro-rated figures for
most data on the same day as the raw figures.

The Czech Republic could have a 50,000- 100,000 tonne sugar surplus from this year's campaign but little will be exported due to high local production costs and a world sugar surplus, sugar experts say.
The Agriculture Ministry said the state would buy some surplus sugar for strategic reserves and would prepare indirect support for exporters but it ruled out direct export subsidies.
Industry sources varied in their assesment of potential foreign markets but agreed producers will try to sell as much as they can at home as world prices were considerably lower.
"It is expected that the surplus will be up to 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes," said Eva Divisova of the ministry, adding that total production will be between 520,000 and 540,000 tonnes raw value after last campaign's 460,035 tonnes.
She added net sugar exports in 1996 should be about 4,000 tonnes. Divisova declined to say how much the state would buy for its reserves from this year's crop, nor what the reserves are, saying this was secret.
"State reserves will be filled, other parts will have to be exported. But it is very difficult to get to foreign markets," Divisova added.
She said Slovakia was not importing due to higher output. There are payment problems with Ukraine and Russia, but former Yugoslav countries were potentially interesting, she said.
Director of trading firm Agrointernational Petr Prochazka believed the surplus would total 50,000-80,000 tonnes, most of which would stay in the Czech Republic.
"The surplus will not be so dramatic...There are quite good yields but the harvest is going slowly due to bad weather. A forecast freeze and subsequent warming will limit output."
"Producers will not want to export...(because of low prices) Those who can store it, will, he told Reuters, adding he believed the state could buy up to 20,000 tonnes for reserves.
Secretary of the Sugar Refiners' Association Vladimir Ulrich also saw a 50,000-80,000-tonne surplus but said it could be partially swallowed by the state and the elasticity of domestic consumption. But he stressed that financial costs of storing sugar could push producers to sell at any price.
Ulrich said local prices have dropped to 12-15 crowns per kilo from 16 earlier in the year. The market is protected by a 68.4 percent tariff, which will drop next year to 65 percent.
"We are pushed from two sides -- the domestic surplus and low price on the world market. If prices drop further, other sugar could get here," Ulrich told Reuters.
Breweries could buy up to 10,000 tonnes more than they usually do if prices go below the costs of malt, and citric acid makers could take care of another 10,000 tonnes, Ulrich said.
"There is a hunger for sugar in Bulgaria, Romaina, Ukraine, also in Russia," said Ulrich. He added that Poland, which itself expects to have a sizeable surplus, was also a potential market.
"We also cannot expect to supply the London exchange, because our sugar does not meet the conditions," added Prochazka.
He said Czech exporters could also look to traditional markets like Saudi Arabia..."Of course, the price would be poor."
The ministry and Ulrich said the surplus would lead to a smaller sown area next year after 104,115 hectares this year. "I believe the optimal area for next few years would be between 90,000 and 94,000 hectares," Ulrich said.

Czech  Ceska Rafinerska a.s. closed a cracking unit at its Litvinov refinery on Monday after the second fire in eight days struck the plant, company spokesman Ales Soukup said.
But he said the restoration of crude processing, which was halted after the first fire, would continue.
A fire broke out on Sunday night in a furnace of a cracking unit as crude flow resumed after an eight-day stoppage.
Oil flow had been halted since a blaze in another part of the refinery began on November 23 and lasted for more than two days. The latest fire was put out several hours after it started.
Soukup told Reuters that the current resumption of production at the refinery would continue as crude is diverted around the cracker.
The shutdown of the cracker would limit the content, not the amount, of processed crude, Soukup said.
"This (cracking) unit will be out of order for some time, and therefore the refinery will operate in a substitution regime. It will affect the depth of processing," he said.
The extent of damage at the refinery, near the northern town of Litvinov, has not yet been determined. Soukup said reopening the cracker "was not a question of hours or days."
An explosion in the refinery's tanking station on November 23 sent flames visible for several kilometres into the air and caused dense smoke to roll into neighbouring Germany.
Soukup said the causes and damage from both fires were under investigation.
After the earlier fire, officials from Rafinerska, petrol firms and the government decided that supplies from the Kralupy refinery and in the distribution network were sufficient in the short term, and state reserves would not be tapped.
In a deal completed last year, the IOC consortium of three foreign oil groups bought a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska, a company set up to operate the two main Czech refineries at Litvinov and Kralupy.
The IOC is equally owned by DuPont Co unit Conoco of the United States, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Italy's Agip SpA.
The state holds the remaining 51 percent stake in Rafinerska through the holding company Unipetrol a.s..

Czech surgeons began exploratory surgery on President Vaclav Havel on Monday to remove a spot from his lung, but the former dissident playwright has said that his health was not in serious danger.
Havel's office announced in a statement that a news briefing would be held on Monday afternoon after the operation but an official said it was impossible to say how the long the surgery would last.
Havel, a heavy smoker who spent almost five years in communist jails, has been ill for several weeks.
But in his weekly radio address, broadcast on Sunday, he was in an optimistic mood, saying the operation would "remove some sort of bad point or spot found on my lungs, the character of which is still unknown".
"However, even if it is something bad, it is so small and its location is so favourable that it seems that I am in no serious danger," he said in the address, recorded on Friday.
Havel, who led the 1989 "Velvet Revolution" which overthrew communism, said in the address from his hospital bed: "I am here not because my state of health is worsening".
"On the contrary, never in the past few weeks have I felt as well as I feel just now."
Havel, who is widely respected at home and abroad, was admitted to hospital last Monday, more than a week after his office said he was suffering from pneumonia. Later surgeons described the planned surgery as "medium serious".
The Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.
Havel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.
Under the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel's place.
Havel's power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.
Opinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.
Turnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.
Havel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.
The Czech Republic's sole supplier of natural gas, Russia's Gazprom, has agreed to start talks on a long-term supply deal, Industry and Trade minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Tuesday.
He said the talks would focused on a contract for supplies of 8.9 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year.
"Today's offer respects this conclusion (of the Czech government to diversify supplies)," Dlouhy told a news conference after meeting Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev.
"That means supplies of only 8.9 bcm, and an agreement to start negotiations on a long-term contract. I consider this to be a good result," he said.
The Czech Republic currently imports all of its roughly nine bcm of natural gas a year from Gazprom under a three-year contract ending in 1998, extendable for another three years.
Dlouhy said Gazprom had accepted that the Czechs want to partially diversify their gas supplies.
"Until now, they have been trying to save the 100 percent coverage. Today they came with an offer -- not all supplies from Russia," he added.
The consumption is expected to rise to about 12 to 13 bcm per year in several years. The country wants to cover the increase from alternative sources.
Dlouhy's deputy, Miroslav Tvrznik, told reporters that the aim was to bring the contract with Gazprom to "a European standard of 15 to 25 years".
Dlouhy said talks would start with several potential partners to choose how to diversify the supplies. These talks would be included in a report to the full cabinet which should make a "more concrete" decision next January, Dlouhy said.
"We would want to have the first supplies from diversified sources already in the year 1997," he said.
He added that some of the options would include buying Russian gas through an intermediary, possibly through Dutch company Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and Germany's Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF.
Dlouhy said these partners would provide a guarantee of supplying from their own sources in case of emergency.
He also said an earlier announced option of buying some gas from Norway was still under consideration, and said that Germany's  BEB Erdgas und Erdoil, or U.S.-based Mobil could serve as "supplementary sources".

The Czech Agriculture Ministry on Friday halted a shipment of U.S. maize thought to contain genetically-manipulated strains, pending further study on its effects.
Until the study is finished no maize from the shipment will be distributed in the Czech Republic, it added.
Frantisek Havir of the ministry's agriculture production section said the Institute for Agricultural Production would conduct the study as soon as possible.
"The state Veterinary Administration is halting the shipment of maize...until it is decided whether these genes can pass into the food chain," Havir said.
On Thursday, protestors in Hamburg disrupted loading of the shipment, chaining themselves to the trains bound for the Czech Republic, where laws regulating how genetically manipulated products should be treated do not exist.
The exact location of the 33,000 tonne shipment was unknown, but the Czech chapter of Greenpeace carried on with the protest on Friday, with five demonstrators dressing up as laboratory rabbits.
"Today, the issue is that there is a precedent being made. There is no legislation in the Czech Republic regulating dealing with genetically-modified materials," said Vaclav Masku of Greenpeace.
The protests are the latest of several blockades in Europe in recent weeks aimed a halting the import of genetically altered soybeans, and now maize.
It is illegal to market such modified maize in the EU, though Greenpeace says cargoes may have already reached Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
An EU Commission is due to decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of such modified maize, made in the U.S. under licence by Swiss chemicals company Ciba  CIGZsn.S Geigy AG.
U.S. exporters do not separate the maize, estimated to amount to 0.6 percent of their crop, from conventional maize.
Havir, who met Greenpeace protestors before the news conference, said the Czechs would cooperate with the EU in any way possible, in addition to conducting its own study.
But he added: "Genetically-modified commodities do not have to be dangerous. Their usage is a great advance in agriculture."
The Czech government on Tuesday approved the text of a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation with Germany, paving the way for its initialling on Friday.
The declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland region of what was then Czechoslovakia.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told reporters after a weekly government meeting that he had been authorised to sign the text, which took two years to negotiate, without changes.
"The government has closed the debate by this text and it sees no chance, opportunity or reason to make any changes to it...Negotiation on the text has ended for us, I'm saying that unambiguously," Klaus said.
The foreign ministers of the two countries are now due to initial the text in the Czech capital on Friday. Signature by the two presidents and confirmation by the parliaments are expected early next year.
"In this declaration it is clearly stated that the will of both sides is to close the past, to close the negative chapters of our history. This declaration means a clear turn in our relations toward the future," Klaus said.
The text has angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate for property lost during the expulsions.
Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), the political sponsor of the expelled Germans which has in the past hinted it might use its weight in the Bonn government to block the declaration, has given qualified support to the text.
But on Tuesday the CSU government of Bavaria, home of most expellees, made a number of demands.
It said it could accept the declaration only if both Bavaria and the official Sudeten German representatives were allowed to participate in a planned fund for German-Czech projects.
And it picked up a key condition which Prague has so far rejected, saying that it expected a commitment, "no later than when the declaration is signed, that the Czech side will hold talks with the representatives of the Sudeten German community".
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, have said they still had concerns about vague wording on compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million) and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that to finance "projects of common interest" including joint environmental, historical and scientific projects and youth meetings.
But the text adds: "The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National Socialist violence."

Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), political sponsor of the expelled Germans, said its support for the text was not guaranteed.
Final approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudetens would be "involved at an appropriate level" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn.
The Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudetens were given better terms.

A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: "Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name."
Secretary (with no hesitation): "Doctor."
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles.
It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained "Doctor of Law" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.
"In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree," Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as "Mr. Engineer" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or "Mr. Doctor", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised "JUDr" moniker in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.
"I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have," said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of "Dr." for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless "Velvet Revolution" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
"He made himself a name, not a title," Lidove Noviny wrote.

Volkswagen AG Czech unit Skoda Auto a.s. said on Monday its new mid-sized "Octavia" sedan will list on its home market at a base price of 335,700 crowns ($12,800), at the low end of its class.
At a media presentation at the plant north of Prague, marketing chief Detlef Wittig said Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias next year, and raise production to 90,000 in 1998.
The new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, will be available with three petrol and two diesel engines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns.
The Octavia will get its international test at the Paris International Auto Show in October and should be delivered to Czech dealers in November, followed by launches on foreign markets where prices have yet to be determined.
Skoda was taken over by Volkswagen in 1992 under a government privatisation plan. The company built an entirely new factory for Octavia production.
Continuing the break from the boxy communist-era Skodas, the Octavia has more modern but conservative lines, somewhere between a Ford Mondeo and Audi's A-line.
Skoda is hoping to build on the success of its Felicia economy five-door hatchback by offering an affordable middle-range sedan and take back chunks of its home market lost to Czechs seeking a more western-looking status symbol.
"Octavia... is a logical step from Felicia into a higher market segment," said Wittig.
The cheapest Octavia includes a 1.6 litre, 55 Kw engine, ignition immobiliser, driver-side airbag, plus an adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel.
More expensive versions will be alternatively equipped with a 1.6/74 kw, 20-valve 1.8/92 kw engine, 1.9/66 kw turbodiesel or 1.9/50 kw diesel engine, and an optional passenger-side airbag.
Side-body airbags should be available in mid-1997.
Wittig told reporters that Octavia should help Skoda's total production to rise to 350,000 units next year and 400,000 at the turn of the century after 251,000 cars made this year.
"Within the (VW) concern, Skoda takes the position of the counterweight to the Asian producers," he added.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said that he expected about 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the domestic market, the rest being exported to the rest of Europe and overseas.
The company lost 1.621 billion crowns last year due to heavy investments into the new factory, but Kalma said the firm should come close to breaking even this year.

The Czech ruling centre-right coalition agreed on Monday to name Vlasta Parkanova as justice minister, replacing Jan Kalvoda who resigned last month after he admitted to using an unattained "Doctor of Law" title.
But coalition leaders agreed to wait on the choice of a replacement for Kalvoda, who is chairman of a small right-wing junior coalition party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), in the more politically-sensitive post of deputy prime minister.
"We received an official proposal from the ODA for a new justice minister... as Doctor Parkanova. We approved this proposal by the ODA on the coalition level," Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the head of the senior Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference.
After a meeting with his coalition partners Klaus said that Parkanova could be officially appointed by President Vaclav Havel as soon as Tuesday.
Parkanova, 45, a certified doctor of law, currently serves as a chief of staff at the Interior Ministry.
She would become the first woman to have a seat in the Prague government since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.
ODA vice chairman Karel Ledvinka said the coalition agreed to a request by his party to postpone nomination of the new deputy prime minister, who would lead the party in the tenuous minority cabinet, until after the party's congress in March.
Kalvoda's position as chairman of the pro-business ODA is also to be decided at the March party congress.
The ODA has four seats in the 16-member cabinet under a coalition agreement with the ODS and the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), plus one of four deputy premierships.
Kalvoda and the KDU-CSL leader Josef Lux have fought heated policy battles with Klaus's party, which controls half of the cabinet, but the coalition remains the longest-running conservative government in post-Communist Europe.
Tensions have been heightened since June when the coalition lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.
Kalvoda, a parliamentary deputy and a cabinet member since the coalition was formed in 1992, was the fifth member of parliament who admitted using the title of Juris Doctor without actually having qualified for it.
Out of the other four fake doctors, only one has resigned her parliamentary seat.
The Czech government delayed payments and forced some early collections in order to allow it to claim its fourth straight budget surplus in 1996, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said on Tuesday.
Kocarnik told a news conference that it was not yet clear whether the 1996 budget balancing measures and a slowdown in forecast economic growth would require cuts in 1997 spending.
The 1996 budget showed a 419 million crown ($15.4 million) surplus on revenues of 482.797 billion crowns while expenditure totalled 482.378 billion, according to finance ministry figures which are still subject to revision.
The surplus came as a shock to many after the government said in December that it was trying to hold an expected deficit to around one billion crowns.
Kocarnik said the government took 650 million crowns in early repayment on credit to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and froze one billion crowns in infrastructure investment to help the 1996 budget.
"This investment was reallocated to the following years," he said, without elaborating.
He added that ministries were also asked to save as much as possible in December, and banks Ceska Sporitelna a.s. and IPB a.s. agreed to delay their receipt of 800 million crowns in state support on housing loans.
Both banks are partially privatised, but the state still holds major stakes in each.
Kocarnik said that final 1996 result might still show a deficit since bills will keep coming until January 15.
He noted that the 1995 budget surplus ended at a revised 7.2 billion crowns from the finance ministry's originally reported 8.6 billion crowns, after various revisions.
Kocarnik repeated his committment to keep this year's budget balanced as well.
"It is early to talk about corrections (in 1997 spending) now, we do not know the final 1996 figures yet, but if they (cuts) will be needed, I will of course propose them," he said.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who calls balanced budgets the "alpha and omega" of his government, has praised the figures as a sign of the country's continued fiscal responsibility.
In the autumn, the government made across the board spending cuts to avoid a forecast 9.3 billion crown shortfall, caused by high-than-expected spending, slow repayments on credits to Russia, and lower than expected tax revenue.
The 1996 budget was originally approved as a balanced budget totalling 497.6 billion crowns, but autumn spending cuts knocked the forecast expenditure down to 491 billion crowns.
Parliament approved a fifth straight balanced budget plan in December, with both expenditures and revenues forecast at 549.1 billion crowns in 1997.
But the 1997 budget was based on economic growth of 5.4 percent, and many independent analysts have forecast growth for this year at under five percent, after growth between 4.0 and 4.5 percent for the whole of 1996.
Many have voiced concern that slower than expected economic growth might force the government to consider major changes in the 1997 budget to keep Klaus's budget record entact. -- Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003 ($1=27.22 Czech Crown)
The Czech government on Wednesday approved rules for a tender to sell a stake of about 34 percent in the financially troubled jet aircraft maker Aero Vodochody a.s. to a strategic partner.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told a news conference after a cabinet meeting, that the tender is open to both domestic and foreign investors, despite hints from some ministers that the sale might be geared toward domestic companies.
The winner is to be announced on April 2.
The Czech chemical and arms conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. has shown an interest in Aero, as well as U.S. Boeing Co in an alliance with Czech air carrier Ceske Aerolinie a.s., and local trading company CIMEX Holding a.s..
Aero is pinning hopes of recovering from financil problems on its flagship L-159, a light training subsonic fighter currently in its final stages of development, which is to be equipped with Rockwell International Corp. avionics.
The Czech army has signed up to buy 72 L-159s, and the government has already approved a 3.26 billion crown package clearing the heavily indebted company's books.
State-controlled shareholders approved a cut in Aero's basic capital last month to one milion crowns from 962 million, and to subsequently underwrite a rights issue to raise equity to between 1.74 and 2.5 billion crowns as a part of the deal.
Klaus said the criteria approved by the cabinet include that Aero will not pay out dividends until production of new L-159 starts, and that the investor has to pay most of the price of the shares from his own assets, not on credit.
He said a commission would be set up to consider bids, including representatives of the privatisation agency National Property Fund (NPF), ministries of interior, industry and trade, foreign affairs, defence, finance, and other officials.
Section Director at the Industry and Trade Ministry, Pavel Stejskal, told Reuters that "roughly 34 percent stake was available" for the tender.
He added that the chosen investor would underwrite a new share issue.
Klaus said the state would keep at least a 34 percent stake in the future.
Aero Holding a.s., majority owned by the NPF, holds 44 percent stake in Aero Vodochody, while the state-owned bank Konsolidacni Banka s.p.u. has 32 percent, while the banks IPB a.s. and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. have 16 and eight percent respectively.

The main Czech oil refiner, Ceska Rafinerska a.s., said on Wednesday it would reopen the hydrocracking unit at its Litvinov refinery, damaged by a fire last month, by the end of January.
Company spokesman Ales Soukup said that the fire on December 2, and another apparently unrelated fire eight days before that, would have some effect on 1996 earnings, but he said it was not yet clear to what extent.
"The refinery is in full operation... the cracking unit was put aside. It should be reopen by the end of January," Soukup told Reuters.
He said that the refinery, in the northwest of the country, was processing crude at normal levels, but the depth of quality of the processing was lower due to the absence of the cracker.
"(The fires) will certainly have some impact, on the other hand, the company is insured, so a number of those damages will be paid for," he said.
Soukup added that final results for last year should be known at the end of the first quarter.
The fire affecting the hydrocrcker broke out on December 2 in a furnace of the unit, just as crude flow resumed after an eight-day stoppage.
Oil flow had been halted when a blaze ripped through a tanking terminal in another part of the refinery on November 23.
They were the first major reported incidents at the refinery since a western consortium took a major equity stake in the newly created Ceska Rafinerska at the end of 1995.
In a deal completed last year, the IOC consortium of three foreign oil groups bought a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska, a company set up to operate the two main Czech refineries at Litvinov and Kralupy, earlier belonging to Chemopetrol Group a.s. and Kaucuk Group a.s. .
The IOC is equally owned by DuPont Co unit Conoco of the United States, Royal Dutch/Shell , and Italy's Agip SpA .
The state holds the remaining 51 percent stake in Rafinerska through the holding company Unipetrol a.s..
The remaining parts of Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, both controlled by the state, are to complete a merger into Unipetrol with a share swap planned for later this year.
Unlike recent January's, Czech refineries are recieving Russian crude supplies normally through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, which had frequent New Year's flow interruptions the past two years because of rows over transit fees between Moscow and Kiev.

Bidders for a stake in troubled Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody a.s. must offer at least 950 million Czech crowns ($35 million) for the shares, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday.
But he told a news conference that the tender, open to domestic and foreign bidders seeking to revitalise the light jet maker, might be geared toward choosing a Czech partner.
Between 34 and 40 percent of Aero will be sold, depending on how many new shares are issued during the deal, rules for which the cabinet approved on Wednesday.
Dlouhy said a steering committee would evaluate bids in the tender, which is expected to open by the end of the month, based on bidders' economic strength, obligations to other shareholders and their strategic position.
The Czech chemical and arms conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. has shown an interest in Aero, as well as local trading company CIMEX Holding a.s., and Boeing Co of the United States in an alliance with Czech airline Ceske Aerolinie a.s..
Dlouhy said Aero shareholders controlled by the state would pass their shareholders' rights to the new investor to allow it to manage the company from a majority position.
The winner of the tender, ultimately picked by the cabinet, should be known in April.
Dlouhy said strategic considerations might persuade the steering committee to pick a Czech domestic partner for Aero.
"If, for example, the Defence Ministry submits arguments which persuade the commission that it is necessary... to prefer a domestic investor, it will be a criterion ... followed by the commission.
"But we do not want to consider it open only for domestic companies from the beginning," he said.
Shareholders of the debt-strapped company approved a cut in Aero's basic capital last month to one million crowns from 962 million, as part of an overall a financial restructuring plan. They also agreed to underwrite a rights issue to raise equity to between 1.74 and 2.5 billion crowns as a part of the deal.
