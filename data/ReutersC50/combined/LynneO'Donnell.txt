China has emerged from the cocoon of last week's National Day celebrations to swoop on the world's soybean and soymeal markets, snapping up a total of between 600,000 and 800,000 tonnes, traders said on Tuesday.
One trader in the region took the credit for a full half of 800,000 tonnes of beans and meal business that he said had been done with Chinese buyers in the past four trading days.
"There has been a chunk of business going on," he said.
"I guess total meal and beans done since last Wednesday is 800,000 tonnes, with 200,000 to 300,000 of it beans and 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of it meal," he said.
Chinese buyers jumped into the market as soon as the National Day holiday was over, he said, expressing his surprise at how fast the usually cautious Chinese reacted to price falls.
China celebrated the 47th anniversary of the founding of the communist-ruled People's Republic on October 1 with an extended public holiday that saw government, business and trade closed for three weekdays last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
During that time, soy product prices fell significantly on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on trade concerns that the U.S. crop would be higher than previously thought.
Talk of Chinese interest has helped CBOT values move up a little in the past week.
Reports that China last week bought between 120,000 and 150,000 tonnes of soymeal for November/December delivery from the United States, South America and India helped propel CBOT soy product futures higher on Monday. Soymeal was $2.10 per tonne higher to $0.10 lower, with October up $2.10 at $246.20 a tonne.
The price falls coincided with one of China's peak buying periods for soybeans, soybean meal and vegetable oil.
The regional trading source claiming half the recent business as his own said he sold meal at $300 c&amp;f (cost and freight) and beans at $5 to $10 a tonne above that.
The soybeans were of U.S. origin, he said, meal spread between the United States and South America. Shipments would begin in October/November for December/January arrival.
Buyers were numerous, he said, and all the purchases were for consumption.
While the other half of the business could not be immediately confirmed, one other Asian trader said he believed a total of 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal business had been done with China since the National Day break.
Chinese buyers were looking for low protein meal at $290 a tonne, and beans at between $290 and $300 a tonne, he said.
"I don't think this price will fly, but as usual PRC buyers start off low and see how low they can get it," he said.
Meal business concluded since last Wednesday was 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes, he said, with beans 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes.
Competitive freight rates in a tight market were helping keep c&amp;f values down, trading sources said, adding vessels could be found at $18 to $20 a tonne from the United States to China.
China had been expected to buy up to 500,000 tonnes of soybeans before December, and up to 400,000 tonnes after March 1997, a Chinese trader said.
"That's to make sure they have enough in stock before new-crop meal comes into the market, which will be January at the earliest. And then enough in stock before Chinese New Year (in February 1997)," he said.
"So we're right on target," he said.

Chinese importers are expected to make incremental use of import quotas for 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil to avoid driving up the world price and pushing down the domestic price, Far East traders said on Friday.
China still has significant stocks of edible oil -- reported in official media to be 2.8 million tonnes by the end of October 1995 -- which could even keep China out of the palm oil market until early 1997, traders said.
A flurry in Malaysian palm oil futures prices on Friday, as speculators reacted to news the Chinese government had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil, was a knee-jerk reaction, trading sources around the region said.
"This is just panic short-covering and speculative interest," a Singapore trader said.
"People are just looking at the volume of 1.3 million tonnes, they are not looking at the market reality," he said.
Import licences could be extended, said another trader, as those issued in 1995 had been for six months.
"This is just the normal annual allocation," he said. "Unless China buys a couple of hundred thousand tonnes a month, there is no justification for a market move, this is just on the news.
"People have been talking about it for a month or more. There is no need (for China) to hurry," he said.
Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said on Thursday China had approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.
Malaysia would provide 80 percent of China's palm oil, Lim said, with the remainder coming from Indonesia.
At midday, the benchmark third position November crude palm oil futures contract was up 20 ringgit to 1,180 riggit (US$473.33) a tonne. Among refined products, November/December RBD palm olein was traded at $550 a tonne FOB Malaysia.
Traders said domestic Chinese palm oil prices were around 6,500 yuan ($783) a tonne.
Using the November/December bulk palm olein FOB Malaysia price as a benchmark, traders said importing did not make economical sense for China as costs, freight, insurance, and import and value-added taxes would push the price up to 7,552 yuan ($910) a tonne.
"They are not likely to use the quotas straight away," another trader said.
Annual per capita consumption of edible oil in China is six kg (13.2 lb), compared with the average 16 kg (35.2 lb) in developed countries.
Traders said China had been importing about 100,000 tonnes a month of palm oil, mostly as bulk palm olein, up to June.
Palm olein is used by the food industry for manufacture of ice cream and cakes; palm oil is used for frying in the production of instant noodles.
Customs figures released this week show China's edible oil imports, including palm oil, in the first seven months of 1996 were 1.74 million tonnes, down 26.9 percent from the same period in 1995. July vegetable imports were nil, the figures show.
Palm oil imports for the first seven months of 1996 totalled 582,000 tonnes, trading sources said, down 40 percent on the same 1995 period.
Overbuying in 1995 was still hanging over the market, traders said. Some sources have predicted that current vegetable oil stocks could last until the end of 1996, and they point to soft domestic prices as proof.
Indeed, prices indicated in Shanghai on Wednesday showed vegetable oil prices falling to as low as 6,700 yuan ($807) a tonne, from 7,000 ($843) a tonne two weeks ago.
Soyoil fell to 7,200 a tonne, from around 7,500 two weeks ago, according to figures from the National Grains and Oils Information Centre.
China is not expected to be in the international market for sugar before mid-1997 as stocks are high and domestic prices are recovering in the lead up to the harvest, traders and Western industry sources said on Wednesday.
But a lack of cash among state-run sugar processors could affect farmers' willingness to keep growing sugar cane and pressure the industry in the long-term, they said.
China had up to two million tonnes of processed sugar in reserve after massive imports in 1995 that have yet to be fully absorbed, a Hong Kong trader said.  
"No one knows the actual figure because it's a state secret," he said of China's sugar reserves.
"I would think there is something between one and two million tonnes, because they imported 3.3 million tonnes in 1995 and it takes a long time to use up," he said.
China's sugar demand had not increased by very much over the eight million tonnes of recent years, traders said.
"China's economy in 1996 has not been that good, so consumption has not really gone up," another Asian trader said.
"Sugar is not an essential item in China and people can go without it when money is tight," he said.  
The bulk of the Chinese market is industrial, traders said.
Central authorities are expected to maintain tight control over the sugar industry, encouraged by the success of an ongoing crackdown on smuggling, traders said.
Millions of tonnes of sugar were smuggled into China in 1994 and 1995 on false or altered import licences, flooding the market and pushing ex-factory prices below break-even point.
The crackdown, which was long and severe, brought some control back to the sugar industry, traders said, and prices are finally starting to move up.
No licences had been issued this year, traders said.  
A tonne of processed sugar in major production areas in the southwest of the country is now fetching 4,100 to 4,200 yuan (US$494-$506), up from 3,800 yuan (US$458) a tonne a few months ago, traders and industry executives said.
The head of a Western company with joint venture interests in Guangxi province said this was "putting a smile on our faces for the first time in months".
Government-set cane purchasing prices in Guangxi, China's major sugar grower, have not been raised from last season's 250 to 280 yuan ($30-33) a tonne, he said.  
But many state-run sugar processors lacked cash to pay farmers for the cane they grew last season, and had either been late in paying or had handed over IOUs instead, he said.
China News Service, a semi-official agency in Hong Kong, reported in August the Agricultural Bank of China's Guangxi branch had been ordered to lend 400 million yuan ($48 million) to the province's sugar industry to buy 100,000 tonnes of sugar.
Many farmers had already planted cane for the current season when the cash shortages began to bite, but they might be discouraged from planting again if the same happens this year, the Western industry source said.  
China's sugar harvest begins in mid-November and according to the official Xinhua News Agency could climb two million tonnes over 1995's 5.65 million tonnes.
Customs figures released in late September show China's sugar exports in the first eight months of 1996 were up 310.1 percent on the same year-ago period to 462,459 tonnes.
Imports fell 54.9 percent in that time to 830,000 tonnes, the figures show.
China permits raw sugar imports for the purpose of tolling, or processing and re-exporting.

China's decision to ban imports of some U.S. chicken meat due to concerns about a fowl plague could hit a multi-million dollar export business, although U.S. officials said on Friday their chickens do not have the disease.
"We don't have highly pathogenic avian influenza (A.I.) in the U.S.," a U.S. quarantine official told Reuters.
"There is no record of it being found in domestic poultry," he said. It had been eradicated after an outbreak in the 1980s.
"It affects the birds but not the meat, the meat does not transmit anything to people."
Washington's agriculture attache in Beijing notified his head office on Thursday that China had blocked imports of chicken meat from 10 U.S. states because of concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza.
U.S. sources in Beijing said China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) had confirmed the ban by telephone on Friday and was preparing notification which was expected some time next week.
"We initially heard about a ban on the import of poultry chicks, but no one at CAPQ has been able to confirm or deny that," a senior diplomatic source said.
"Now, if poultry chicks aren't banned for reasons of A.I., why is poultry meat banned? It makes no sense," he said.
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) representatives would probably meet Ministry of Agriculture officials on Tuesday in a bid to resolve the issue, an embassy source said.
Asked to confirm reports of the block on chicken imports, a quarantine official in Beijing told Reuters by telephone: "It is true." He declined to give details.
Officials of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation (Ceroils) said they had heard of the ban but also declined to give further information.
Customs officials said they were unaware of the ban.
U.S. officials in Beijing on Friday said any ban China might place on U.S. chicken meat imports because of avian influenza was not based on sound scientific evidence.
"It comes down to good science versus bad science," a senior official said on condition of anonymity.
Poultry meat was not a likely vehicle for transmission of the virus, he said, and U.S. poultry meat exports posed no threat to the international poultry industry.
The ban could have a major impact on U.S. poultry exports to China. In 1995, 330,000 tonnes worth US$445 million was trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
China is the second largest market for U.S. poultry products after Russia, the council's Hong Kong director, Sarah Li, said.
"It is the only market to take paws," she said, referring to chicken feet. "People say U.S. chickens need wheelchairs because all their feet are going to China."
Thirty containers a day of chicken feet moved from Hong Kong into China, she said. Any hold-ups would cost importers dearly because of the high cost of storage in Hong Kong.
The Chinese chicken ban is the latest headache for U.S. agriculture officials in China who have been dealing with fears of importing potentially tainted products for over 20 years.
Wheat is a continuing issue, with China refusing to import grain from the U.S. Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington claims the fungus is harmless, that the ban is not based on good science, that it cuts annual U.S. wheat sales to China by 500,000 tonnes and is a non-tariff trade barrier.
China, on the other hand, says TCK smut could cut domestic wheat yields if it got into the domestic growing areas.

The drop in prices following the changes in Russia could have put some U.S. producers out of business had it continued, he said.

Asian traders raised their eyebrows on Monday at reports that China had bought hundreds of thousands of tonnes of soybean oil, saying authorities had issued import licences for only a fraction of that.
"Total quota issued (for soybean oil imports) were a little over 100,000 tonnes," a trader in Shanghai said.
"People with quota are not in a hurry to import," he said, because c&amp;f (cost and freight) prices to China were still too high for local buyers.
A Chinese trader in Hong Kong concurred, saying high domestic stocks and a near-record domestic rapeseed crop of eight million tonnes meant there was as yet no demand in China for imported vegetable oil.
Rumours swept the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Friday that China may have bought 173,000 to 200,000 tonnes of South American soybean oil in the previous few days.
Argentine soybean oil was trading on Thursday at US$500 a tonne FOB (free on board) for October delivery while U.S. soybean oil was $510 a tonne, sources in the U.S. said.
Asian traders said these levels were still a good $40 away from prices Chinese buyers would be willing to pay.
But an official of Beijing's food trading arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp (COFCO) told Reuters China had not yet issued new soybean oil quota or import licences for 1996.
Quotas for 1995 had expired at the end of June, she said. Palm oil import quotas had been issued in July, she said, but declined to give more details.
China could come into the market for vegetable oil late in 1996 or early in 1997 to make sure there was enough in stock for Chinese New Year in February, traders said.
A Chinese source said 140,000 tonnes of soyoil import licences were issued by central authorities in August.
He said 50,000 tonnes of soyoil had already been imported on that quota, and 40,000 tonnes of quota had been allocated to Tibet so licences could be sold there for cash.
Authorities in Tibet, contacted by telephone, said they were unaware of this.
One trading house source in the region reported a busy day on the telephone on Monday, fielding Chinese inquiries for soybean oil. He thought perhaps this was an indication quota had been issued.
Relevant officials with the Ministry of Agriculture could not be immediately reached for comment.
An executive with an international marketing organisation who met Shanghai grain bureau officials last week said they had no indication of when import quotas for vegetable oil would be issued.
"They said they were going to apply for licences, but they had no idea when they were likely to be issued," she said by telephone.
Prices quoted last Thursday by the National Grains and Oils Information Centre in Shanghai put grade one soybean oil in northeastern Jilin province at 7,000 yuan ($843) a tonne, and grade two in Tianjin at 7,200 yuan ($867) a tonne.
Freight information from Brazil details 18,000 tonnes of vegetable oil due to be loaded for China in early October. No other details were available.
Soyoil imported into China without an import licence carries a 120 percent import tax. Importers with licences must pay 13 percent import duty and a 13 percent value-added tax on top of that.

Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.
"A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China," a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.
"There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of," he said.
Another industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.
Chinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.
Metal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.
Another trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.
"People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again," he said. "And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there."
On top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.
Latest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.
Prices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.
LME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.
A year ago, the price was $1,742.
"Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250," another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: "There is good support at the $1,300 level."
LME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.
"This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it," he said.
Chinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.
"Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit," the European trader said.
Traders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.

Fears China has been cancelling soybean and soybean meal orders in the wake of tumbling world prices came as no surprise to Asian grain traders on Tuesday.
"Prices have dropped US$10 (a tonne) since Friday -- there is the incentive," a Hong Kong trader said.
"If you can buy cheaper material, then you probably will, no matter who or where you are," he said. "But there is no unsold cargo in the market. Most has been committed. We're sold out.
"So the CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) drops $10, can you buy cheaper? No. There is no physical available," he added.
CBOT soymeal prices closed lower on Monday on fears China might have been cancelling soybean and soymeal purchases following the recent price slides, traders there said.
Soymeal closed unchanged to $4 a tonne lower, with October down $1.60 to $235.10 a tonne.
Asian grain traders could not confirm the rumours.
Traders last week reported total soybean and soybean meal purchases by China of up to 800,000 tonnes. The sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week.
The Chinese swoop on the market followed an extended public holiday while China celebrated National Day on October 1.
During those three weekdays of rest -- September 30 to October 3 -- CBOT soy product prices fell on worries among traders the crop would be bigger than expected.
China scooped up between 600,000 and 800,000 tonnes of beans and meal. Traders reported c&amp;f (cost and freight) prices at between $300 and $310 a tonne.
On Tuesday, however, traders said Chinese buyers, notorious for their price consciousness, would be keen to get even better prices and to increase their profit margins.
"Now that Chinese buyers are responsible for their own profit and loss, this is becoming more frequent," another Hong Kong trader said.
The shortage of physical availability would see Chinese buyers who wanted to increase their margins by cancelling previous orders missing out altogether, he said.
"They are still waiting for the dust to settle down, and maybe the price will stabilise in one or two days," he said.
"The price today is affordable for the Chinese but they are wanting prompt delivery and there is none around for them."
China is in the midst of the peak soymeal consumption season and has been expected to import significant quantities before the end of 1996.
The possibility that a new import tax regime will be introduced from January 1, 1997, would serve to dampen orders in December, traders said, and orders for delivery before year-end should be high.
Ideally, imports should arrive before new crop soybean products start coming on to the market in January, a Chinese trader said.
Before then, China should have imported 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of soybean meal to make sure the larders are full for Chinese New Year, which in 1997 falls in February.
"Feed industry demand will go down seasonally after February, so we will see increased domestic supply and decreased demand from February to April," he said.
"Then from April/May demand will go up again so they will need more imports."
This year's soybean crop is expected to be two or three percent down on the 13 million tonnes harvested in 1995.

China has banned imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears the meat carries a fowl plague, a U.S. embassy official in Beijing said Wednesday.
The ban threatens an export market worth about $500 million a year.
"China has placed a ban on imports of all poultry and poultry products from 10 states," the official said.
Chinese authorities had voiced fears the poultry products carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, he said.
The states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Utah Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.
The U.S. embassy official, who asked not to be identified, said there seemed to be some confusion on the part of Chinese quarantine officials over the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI.
"HPAI has not been found in the U.S. since 1984 and we believe there has been some confusion about the type of AI virus found in the United States and noted by China," he said.
A U.S. quarantine official based in China told Reuters last week that the virus could not be transmitted to people who ate the meat of infected birds.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products. It is the only market for U.S. chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tons transshipped through Hong Kong alone, worth $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day 30 23-ton containers of U.S. chicken feet crossed the border from Hong Kong into China, according to the council's spokeswoman, Sarah Li.
The AI virus could be found worldwide, particularly in wild fowl, the embassy official said, and had not been isolated from commercial poultry flocks in the United States.
Another U.S. official told Reuters the AI virus may have been detected in ostriches imported from the United States as breeding stock on Chinese ostrich farms.
"Ostrich raising in China has become very popular and a lot of the breeding stock is brought in from the U.S.," the marketing official said.
"We heard that some of the ostrich breeding stock had been found to have AI," said the official, who requested anonymity.
News of the ban surfaced last week and was confirmed by Chinese quarantine officials to the U.S. embassy on Friday.
Officials of China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing met Tuesday in an effort to resolve the issue, the embassy official said.
"It was a frank, candid and open meeting -- they listened to us and agreed that we should talk more about it, which we will as soon as possible," the official said.
"Basically, we said we think there's been a misunderstanding, but they said what if it (the AI virus) mutates? We said it didn't and they rejected that," he said.
Officials of the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were to travel from the United States to meet their Chinese counterparts, but no date had been fixed.

Smiles are coming back to the faces of Asian sugar traders and industry executives, who are smacking their lips at the prospect of a stabilised Chinese market and decent profits for sugar mills there.
Prices for sugar in China were starting to move to levels not only covering factory costs but providing some profits, trade and industry sources said on Wednesday.
White sugar prices in Beijing and Shanghai were around 4,400 yuan (US$530) a tonne, reflecting prices of three or four months ago, trading sources said.
Ex-factory prices in the growing regions, however, were now a good 300-400 yuan higher, the sources said.
"The lowest price in 1996 was 3,650 renminbi a tonne in the producing areas," a Chinese trader in Hong Kong said.
Transport to the major cities added 150 to 200 yuan, plus handling costs, he said. So current prices were indicative of when the sugar was purchased and stored.
Prices in the producing areas, notably Guangxi and Guangdong provinces in the south, had moved to between 4,500 and 4,700 yuan a tonne.
"The Chinese sugar market is still a very attractive market," an industry executive who runs a number of joint venture sugar factories in southern China said.
"It is not yet fully mature and there will be an inbalance between supply and demand for a long time," he said on condition of anonymity.
He put annual Chinese demand at eight to nine million tonnes.
"The government has stopped imports for the last three months, so I see the market getting back to normal," he said.
Imports in 1995 were 3.3 million tonnes. This year's harvest, which begins next month, is expected to be more than 7.5 million tonnes, over last year's 5.65 million.
Signs the market in China was beginning to stabilise were evident in the recent rise in wholesale prices for processed white sugar, he and other trade and industry sources said.
The tightness reflected in the rising prices would last until the beginning of the crushing season in November.
"The price could go to 5,000 (yuan per tonne)," a trader in Shanghai said.
Stocks of 1.5 to two million tonnes represented two months' consumption at the current peak consumption time, he said.
Even so, traders and industry sources did not see China having to import sugar before the middle of 1997.
Some rumours that China had recently purchased five to 10 cargoes -- or a maximum of 120,00 tonnes -- of Thai sugar were seen as an attempt to push up faltering Thai raw sugar premiums.
"I find it hard to believe because there are no sugar import licences," a Hong Kong trader said.
"The Thai premium was falling below $60 (per tonne) two weeks ago and I suspect people are spreading this rumour to push the premium back up," he said.
The premium on Thai sugar to China had recovered to around $70 for March-May contracts, he said.
Another trader in Hong Kong reported a secret deal in which a monastery in rural Tibet was granted sugar import licences, which it then sold to raise money for restoration work.
He said 50,000 tonnes of import quota was involved, and had been used to purchase raw Cuban sugar at US$3,000 a tonne.
"The central government gave the quota to the lamasery, then the monks sold the quota to raise money," he said.
The only other detail he would provide was that the Cuban sugar was not part of the annual 500,000-tonne barter deal between Beijing and Havana, and that it would arrive in China before the end of 1996.

Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses, confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate, probably belongs to China's strategic state reserve, industry sources said on Friday.
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where some of the strategic stockpile was stored, they said.  
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) in June and July.
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve, administered directly by the central government's State Planning Commission, owned the copper.
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise.  
But one source, the head of a Hong Kong trading house, said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not.
"If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou, it will be sitting there for years," he said.
"Once it arrives in Yingkou, it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission, which has to give permission for any more movement; it is out of the hands of traders," he said.
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months, with traders unsure not only of who owns it, but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it.  
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price.
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve, running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously.  
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$2,700 a tonne, and then paid somewhere between $2,200 and $2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year.
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit, which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs.
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market.  
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes, "whoever they are, is the most important short-term fundamental" in an already tight world market.
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp, with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals.
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement.  
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses. They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases.
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market.
But these concerns were irrelevant, a Singapore trader said, despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year.  
As with many commodities, "there is a desire (by the Chinese government) to keep a stockpile of the metal," he said. "You don't keep it to help industry, you keep it in case of emergency."

Casualties are starting to mount as Chinese buyers of soybeans and soybean meal default or cancel contracts in the wake of falling international prices, Asian trading sources said on Thursday.
"We have stopped doing Chinese business for now," said a trader in Hong Kong with a major international house.
"We're waiting for the market to stabilise and are staying away from the possibility of defaults," he said.
Traders in Hong Kong, Singapore and China reported hearing of Chinese soymeal buyers delaying finance arrangements for orders in an attempt to force sellers to lower their prices.
Another Hong Kong source reported that Chinese buyers had defaulted on three to four cargoes, each of 50,000 tonnes, since last week when international prices began to fall.
"They are defaulting because PRC buyers delayed opening LCs (letters of credit) in the hope of squeezing another two or three dollars from their sellers," he said.
Traders have said these tactics are next to useless as physical soymeal for prompt delivery is tight, and would command a premium that would wipe out any extra profit.
Since entering the international trading arena earlier this decade, Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation for dubious practices when it comes to paying for their orders.
In some cases, traders have reported, a Chinese buyer will default on or cancel an order for a commodity if the price falls after the order is placed and before it is delivered.
The Chinese company will then attempt to replace the commodity at the cheaper rate.
As a result, when prices of a commodity that is a hot item in China begin to fall, some international traders simply exit the market.
Others insist on deposits, and others grade Chinese traders according to their record of paying up and charge higher premiums accordingly.
Soybean meal has been the hot Chinese commodity of 1996, traders said, with arrivals from South America around 1.2 million tonnes since February.
Traders said maximum Chinese orders of U.S. meal in the past two weeks were 300,000 tonnes.
One trader claiming to have done 400,000 tonnes of beans and meal business in the past two weeks said he had letters of credit from his buyers for 350,000 tonnes.
His sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week, he said.
The price of soybean meal on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has been on a rollercoaster ride since late September, and initially dipped while China was on holiday from September 30 to October 3 celebrating National Day.
On October 4, Chinese buyers scooped up more than 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal, mostly of U.S. origin, some South American, paying $300 to $310 a tonne, traders said.
But last Friday, prices started to fall again, by Tuesday coming off another $10 or so a tonne -- and word of Chinese cancellations and defaults began to circle.
Reports from Chicago on Wednesday described the market as perplexed over rumours China had bought or cancelled export orders for U.S. and South American soybeans and soymeal.
CBOT October soymeal closed at $236.30 a tonne, after Tuesday's $235.30.

China has agreed not to enforce a ban on imports of U.S. poultry until after top-level quarantine talks scheduled to take place in Beijing next week, U.S. business and diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
"We understand they (the Chinese authorities) have not issued any letter to the field banning imports, and that they will not until discussions are held," a senior diplomat in Beijing said.
China last week confirmed a ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states because of fears of a fowl plague known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and is its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled $445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.
Officials from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were to arrive in Beijing next Monday for talks with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine on Wednesday, the diplomatic source said.
"We have been told they will hold off on any action until then," he said.
News of the ban surfaced on Oct. 10, when the U.S. agriculture attache in Beijing confirmed to his head office that China feared U.S. poultry products bore the HPAI virus.
U.S. officials say U.S. poultry is free of HPAI virus and that Chinese quarantine personnel are confused about the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI.
"We don't know what they identified," an APHIS official told Reuters. "All we can say is that HPAI is not found in the U.S. The last time it was found (in 1984) it was eradicated and since then we have had no reports of HPAI at all."
AI is prevalent the world over, especially in wild fowl, and had not been isolated in commercial U.S. poultry flocks, he and other U.S. sources said.
"AI is not a concern for vets -- it's like the common cold and is not quarantinable," the APHIS source said.
U.S. and meat industry sources said the HPAI virus had been detected in ostrich breeding stock in the United States destined for ostrich farms in China.
During a trip to Texas by CAPQ personnel to look at U.S. ostriches, 22 birds had tested positive for HPAI, a U.S. source said.
A positive test did not necessarily mean the bird was ill with HPAI, he said, likening it to a tuberculosis skin test which, if positive, did not definitively indicate the presence of TB.

Chile, the world's biggest copper exporter, hopes to forge close trade and technical support ties with China, the world's biggest copper importer, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariano Fernandez said.
"There is Chinese interest in participating in some mining projects in Chile, and we have an interest in participating in service and technology in copper mining in China," Fernandez told Reuters in a recent interview.
Of Chile's total 1995 mining exports worth US$7.85 billion, $280 million was earned from selling copper to China, he said.
"It is not only potential ... this is reality," he said. "If we look ahead, there are some forecasts that in five years we will produce almost one-third of the world's total copper.
"But looking at 1.2 billion (Chinese) people and the rush for development in China, we should not exclude China as a very important client for Chilean copper."
Chile, with 25 percent of world copper reserves, mined 2.512 million tonnes of the red metal in 1995, far ahead of its closest rival the United States, with 1.8 million, and fifth placed China with 435,000 tonnes, Chilean figures show.  
Copper accounted for 36.4 percent of Chile's total exports in 1995 of $16.5 billion, the figures show.
China's 1996 demand for copper has been officially put at one million tonnes.
Its copper imports for 1996 were expected to be 200,000 tonnes, the president of China Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corp, Wu Jianchang, said in May.
Trade and industry sources have speculated recently about China's interest in buying copper properties in Chile, along similar lines to recent investment by major Chinese corporations in Peru's iron ore industry.
But one source with a major regional producer said the high price of Chilean copper mines, combined with a cash squeeze in China and the poor international reputation of Chinese buyers, would keep Chilean producers reluctant to forge long-term ties.
"I don't see China guaranteeing long-term supply contracts," the industry executive, based in Hong Kong, said.
"It is not the way they work because if the prices fall, they are then very reluctant to pay," he said. He was referring to the practice of some Chinese importers of refusing to pay for commodities if the price falls between order and delivery.  
Fernandez did not elaborate on the details of cooperation Chile was hoping for with China. "We are at the beginning (of discussions)," he said.
He was in Hong Kong after a four-day trip to Beijing where he met with senior Chinese officials, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
The purpose of his visit was to lay the groundwork for a visit to Chile on November 6 and 7 by Chinese Premier Li Peng, he said.
Fernandez said he asked Chinese officials to consider recognising Chile as free of Mediterranean fruit fly, as Japan had already done, and free of foot-and-mouth disease.
"The Chilean dream is to sell one apple, one bunch of grapes and one bottle of wine a year to every Chinese person," he said.

International copper prices are likely to stick to the high road for some time yet, pricing the metal out of the key China market, Far East metal traders said on Monday.
"The LME (London Metal Exchange) will move higher and will test US$2,100 (a tonne)," a base metal trader in Hong Kong said.
"We want it to go down. $1,800 to $1,900 is workable."
Copper prices on the LME rallied through the psychological barrier of US$2,000 a tonne on Friday, hitting $2,027 in late afternoon trading.
This rally pushed the international price above the domestic Chinese price, rendering imports senseless, traders said.
On the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the most active February 1997 contract opened at 19,550 yuan ($2,355) a tonne, consolidating around that level within the first half-hour.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) on copper imports, killing margins at current prices, traders said.
Soggy Chinese business would be further dampened, traders said. One source at a Chinese listed company said he had 200 tonnes of the red metal to sell at a premium of $100 over the LME spot price.
The premium on copper, CIF (cost, insurance and freight) to Hong Kong and Chinese ports, was $150 last week, traders said.
"We will not have any import business (with China) with such high LME prices," another trader in Hong Kong said. "We are getting calls from Chinese offering copper back to the market."
"Premiums are not the issue, the total price is the concern -- and even with no premium it is difficult," he said.
Among the bears, the head of a trading house in Hong Kong bullishly noted signs the central government was attempting to stimulate the property market could see copper and aluminium users stocking up.
Cancellation of interest rate subsidies, interest rate reductions and the removal of private car purchase quotas were aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy, he said.
"I think the whole picture will change," he said.
"We have been waiting for a very long time and we have known they (Chinese authorities) are moving in this direction. It will restart cash flow and that will re-stimulate the economy very, very quickly," he said.
He and other traders said Chinese consumers' stocks, usually kept at one month's supply or around 100,000 tonnes, have been run down.
"Consumers have nothing and if they have to accumulate investory in their warehouses because of the change of sentiment, the damage to the market will disappear," he said.
Other sources said the Shanghai Metal Exchange had around 15,000 tonnes of copper in stock.
Drawdowns from LME warehouse stocks over the past couple of months indicated demand in Europe was picking up, traders said.
"If it continues, we will not have enough material, especially as there is no scrap around at the moment and LME stocks are down (to 145,825 tonnes)," said the trading house boss.
"The situation could become critical by the end of the year," he said.
U.S. officials are confident a China visit by senior agricultural experts will break an impasse that threatens a multi-million dollar Chinese market for U.S. poultry products, a U.S. agriculture official said on Tuesday.
"Things are looking good," the official in Beijing told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
"I would say we have all the evidence we think we need to convince them (the Chinese) there is no problem," he said.
Two senior U.S. agriculture officials would arrive in Beijing from Washington on Tuesday evening for meetings with Chinese quarantine and agriculture officials, he said.
The talks starting on Wednesday afternoon would focus on a ban China slapped on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states because of fears they carry a fowl plague known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
China's ban came to light on October 10 but has not yet been implemented as, U.S. sources said, Chinese officials decided to wait and hear first what the U.S. experts had to say.
The talks would initially centre on the technical and scientific aspects of the dispute, the Beijing source said.  
"We're trying to keep it that way so the trade issue does not come into it until the technical side has been presented," he said.
It would become a trade issue if the Chinese side did not accept U.S. scientific evidence "and if we feel they'll enforce a ban that has no technical or scientific basis," he said.
The U.S. side viewed as a favourable sign China's recent approval of two bovine semen centres and nine embryo transfer centres to import U.S. veterinarian technology, he said.
Bilateral meetings were also set for November on plant health, covering fruit imports, and on the long-simmering issue of wheat imports and a wheat fungus called TCK smut.
"And the secretary of state (Warren Christopher) is coming in November, so all of this is helping us negotiate better," the source said.
U.S. diplomats, agriculture officials and meat industry executives say HPAI does not exist in commercial U.S. flocks, having been eradicated in the mid-1980s.
They say China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) is confused about the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI, which one source equated with the common cold.  
The HPAI virus was apparently detected in ostrich breeding stock in Texas destined for ostrich farms in China, and which were being inspected by CAPQ personnel.
Detection of the virus did not mean the bird was diseased, said a U.S. diplomat, likening it to a tuberculosis skin test.
The dispute threatens the United States' second biggest market after Russia for poultry and poultry products, and its only market for chicken feet, considered a delicacy in China.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters that every day about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet cross the border from Hong Kong into China.

Wheat is unlikely to become a casualty of the row between Beijing and Washington over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since higher grain production in China is slashing the need for imports, traders said on Tuesday.
"As far as we see business, we could well not have anything with China for the rest of this year," a U.S. trader said.
"The (Chinese) domestic crop looks good, they have cancelled a lot of orders already. Canada has enough to hold China if they do need to get into the market," she said.
China's 1996/97 wheat production is expected to hit a record 107 million tonnes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said earlier this month, raising its estimate from 104 million tonnes.
As a result, total imports were also revised downward by one million tonnes to eight million tonnes.
A new war of words broke out between Beijing and Washington this month after the Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy missiles and other weaponry worth around US$420 million.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.
China has demanded the United States cancel plans for these latest arms sales to prevent "new damage" to bilateral ties.
Sino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.
Ties had been slowly recovering after reaching a nadir in June 1995 with a U.S. visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui.
China had cancelled around 1.4 million tonnes of wheat orders from the United States since early June, the USDA said.
While some trading sources have speculated that the cancellations could be in retaliation for stalled bilateral negotiations over a fungus called tilletia controversa kuhn, or TCK smut, others put them down to the good Chinese crop outlook.
China is expected, however, to maintain its traditonal level of wheat imports from Canada of around five million tonnes a year. Canadian trade sources have said China's buying programme has already begun.
None of this has deterred U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman from his optimism that China will remain a committed buyer of U.S. wheat.
"I think the key issue myself with China is supplies in China," Glickman said in Chicago on Monday.
China imported 11.59 million tonnes of wheat in 1995, up 58.7 percent from the 7.3 million tonnes the year before.
Chinese and U.S. scientists are making good progress in meetings on China's decision to ban poultry imports from the United States, a U.S. source said on Thursday.
The Chinese government banned all imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states earlier this month for fear it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
Although the ban has yet to be implemented -- China wanted to hear what the U.S. experts had to say first -- it threatens an export market worth around US$500 million a year.
"The first set of meetings on Wednesday were frank, candid and held in a positive atmosphere," the source, who refused to be identified, said by telephone from Beijing.
The meetings are between Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ).
Two APHIS experts arrived in Beijing on Tuesday night and would stay in Beijing for as long as it took to solve the problem, the U.S. source said.
"There is no timetable," the source close to the talks said. "We are willing to take as much time as is needed in order to make sure the Chinese have as much information as they can to make an informed decision based on good science."
Meetings had already been scheduled for Thursday and would, if necessary, continue on Friday, he added.
APHIS experts, U.S. diplomats and meat industry executives say HPAI does not exist in commerical flocks in the United States, having been eradicated in the mid-1980s.
U.S. sources have said Chinese quarantine officials seem to have confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which one APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Sources have said CAPQ officials would be joined by experts from other government departments for what sounded like a series of lectures and presentations by the APHIS team.
The U.S. source in Beijing said the Chinese had so far been receptive and were taking a "very positive approach".
U.S. sources said the plan was to concentrate initially on the technical side of the dispute before raising trade issues.
If the dispute goes beyond the differences the two countries have in interpreting science, Beijing could find itself accused of using bad science as a non-tariff trade barrier.
This is the case with wheat. China refuses to import wheat from specific areas of the United States because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington says the fungus is harmless and that Beijing's policy of zero tolerance is a barrier to an extra 500,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat sales a year to China.

The rise in the London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc price to a five-month high in Asia on Thursday will benefit China, one of the major sources of the metal throughout the Far East, regional traders said.
"It would be good for China because they have a lot of physical metal and they have a lot to sell from producers on the hedge side," a trader with a Chinese company said.
"They might buy from time to time to speculate a bit but basically they are a producer," he said.  
Three month LME zinc hit a five-month high of $1,064/$1,069 a tonne on Thursday, up from the metal's close at $1,054 in London on Wednesday boosted by rumours that famed financier George Soros was making a speculative play in the market.
Few traders in the region expressed surprise at the talk that a large, losing long position once held by the Spanish producer Asturiana de Zinc had been liquidated or transferred and that Soros had bought zinc or zinc-related equities.  
One trader said he heared rumours months ago Soros was buying shares in zinc producers, and had been expected to buy into the metal once his share positions were finalised.
"I think that if Soros is involved the price will move," the source in Singapore said.
And as the world price moves up, so will the Chinese price as regional consumers have few other sources, traders said.
China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys in the first nine months of 1996 were up 16.7 percent on the same period of 1995, to 153,660 tonnes, according to customs figures.
September's exports alone were 19,165 tonnes, they show.  
China's official base metals industry newspaper, China Nonferrous Metals News, estimated late last year that total 1995 zinc production would be 1.05 million tonnes.
With domestic demand expected to be 700,000 tonnes and essential exports to reach 300,000 tonnes, the market should be kept in balance, it said.
China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp (CNNC) said earlier this year that domestic zinc demand would reach 900,000 tonnes by 2000, from 881,600 in 1994 and 465,700 in 1990.  
Supply annually outstripped demand for the metal, CNNC said, with a surplus in 1994 of 142,800 tonnes. Chinese zinc smelter capacity is around 1.2 million tonnes a year.
Traders said Chinese zinc goes to Taiwan -- a big user with total imports of around 200,000 tonnes a year -- Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
Trading sources in Hong Kong, China and Singapore said demand throughout the region remained strong, riding the back of rampant economic development.  
The official China Daily reported last week that domestic Chinese zinc prices would probably drop below 9,000 yuan (US$1,084) a tonne this month, due to oversupply.
However, traders polled by Reuters said the lack of alternative suppliers, other than Australia, would keep export demand for Chinese zinc healthy.
"Far East consumers can only take the Chinese material, because if you ship anything from Europe, the premiums would be even higher," the Chinese trading source said.  
Chinese HX brand zinc sold out of Singapore warehouses at a fixed price of $1,100 or $1,120 a tonne, he said. Higher prices meant lower, more flexible premiums (over LME cash prices).
"When the price is $1,020, the premium is $80, $90, $100 and no one buys. Now the premium (in Singapore warehouses) is $50 for HX brand," he said.
"I think with the LME price coming up so much, with the price coming nearer to $1,100, they will easily let it go at a $50 premium," he said.
Other traders said the premium on Chinese zinc to Indonesia is currently $120 a tonne and to Hong Kong $75-$85.  
Taiwan's construction sector had slowed recently and some traders on the island had been trying to take a position and offer the metal at premiums lower than the $90-$100 levels that prevailed until recently. This has pushed the Taiwan premium down to $70 a tonne, an industry executive said.

Talks aimed at averting a Chinese ban on imports of United States poultry have been hailed as a success by U.S. officials, who said on Friday they expected the issue to vanish without any disruption to a major market.
A Chinese ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states, worth nearly US$500 million a year, was now unlikely to be implemented, official U.S. sources said.
"I'm optimistic that the issue has been resolved," a U.S. diplomat in Beijing said by telephone.
"Hopefully, this thing will now be dropped. I'm not expecting any correspondence or a list -- sometimes no news is good news," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A two-man team from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) spent two days in meetings with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) and scientists from other government departments and universities.
The aim of the talks was to convince CAPQ that U.S. poultry does not carry a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), contrary to Chinese fears that led to the ban.
"We are hopeful this issue has been resolved," said Ray Miyamoto, the APHIS area director in Beijing. "We feel their (CAPQ's) primary concerns were adequately addressed."
Miyamoto added that CAPQ planned to write a report that may or may not be made available to APHIS.
The meetings ended on Thursday. CAPQ was not immediately available for comment.
U.S. sources described the talks as "frank, open and candid" and said they augured well for other discussions slated for November on plant quarantine issues.
Wheat, however, remains shrouded in politics. Washington claims a Chinese ban on accepting wheat from specific U.S. areas because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut is, in effect, a non-tariff trade barrier.
A top-level Chinese delegation is due to leave for the United States this weekend for a two-week TCK fact-finding trip.
The poultry ban came to light on October 10 after U.S. chicken meat imports were blocked. CAPQ confirmed it to U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing the next day in a telephone call.
Nothing was ever received in writing from CAPQ, a source at the embassy said on Friday, and the ban was not implemented as CAPQ wanted first to hear what the U.S. experts had to say.
What the experts said, according to sources close to the meetings, was that HPAI, while widespread in wildfowl, was eradicated from commercial U.S. flocks in the mid-1980s.
The U.S. side seemed convinced that CAPQ had confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which an APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Another U.S. source said the Chinese fears had been fuelled during a visit to Texas by CAPQ personnel to check on ostrich breeding stock destined for farms in southern China.
A number of birds there tested positive for HPAI, the source said, though this did not necessarily mean they were afflicted with the virus.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China every day.

China has given the green light to corn exports but has set a minimum selling price so high above world levels that the grain is going nowhere and farmers are missing out on much-needed cash, traders said on Tuesday.
The selling price for a tonne of Chinese corn has been set at US$170 at a time when the world price is hovering around $140-150 a tonne, sources in Hong Kong and China said.
"The market is dropping so there is no reason for anyone to buy Chinese corn," an agent working in Hong Kong on behalf of Beijing's food trading arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO), told Reuters.
Another veteran trader in the region said COFCO executives had told him the government had agreed in principle to the export of two million tonnes of corn.
"But there is nothing in writing," he said. "We have given them bids at world price levels and they won't touch it."
Neither COFCO nor the State Planning Commission, which issues the licences, were available for comment.
Asian traders said U.S. corn was now arriving at some Asian ports at $145 a tonne inclusive of cargo and freight (c&amp;f).
"It's nonsense to issue such licences -- why not issue them 10 months ago when Chinese corn was cheap and buyers would have lined up," a Shanghai trader said.
"The new (Chinese) crop is coming and the farmers are complaining that they don't have money to buy fertiliser. But still they effectively won't allow exports."
Traders in Asia saw corn prices falling further. Expectations of a huge U.S. harvest totalling more than nine billion bushels or 228.6 million tonnes has pushed prices down by 18 percent since September.
Talk on Monday among traders on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) that China was looking for U.S. corn seemed misplaced, given that China is heading for a record crop of 115-120 million tonnes and has around 30 million tonnes of corn in storage.
CBOT corn closed one to 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower in Monday trading, with December down 1-1/4 to $2.61-3/4.
The lowest offers foreign traders and agents said they had received from Chinese corn sellers, predominantly COFCO and some Chinese trading companies with export permits, was $165 a tonne.
But traders such that price was believed to be just exploratory and was not necessarily an indication that Chinese exporters would undercut the new official price to make sales.
"But so far there is no business concluded and unless the international market price is improving, there will not be," another trader in Hong Kong said.
The FOB (free on board) price at Dalian was $165, they said.
The export permits had been issued with the tacit approval of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, trading and industry sources said.
Zhu had also set the price, sources close to the process said, though one of them added: "He's no fool, he knows he won't sell a pound at that price ($170 a tonne) today".
Corn exports were discussed earlier this year and spurred farmers and traders to ship up to two million tonnes to Dalian to await the green light.
Fear of fuelling inflation and of leaving reserves low in case of an emergency stopped Zhu short of allowing exports, Western grain industry executives who have met with Zhu said.
This saw China miss out on the chance of earning enormous amounts of money -- $175-180 a tonne -- and buying back if necessary in the current cheaper market.
"It's great for the feed industry," the Chinese source said of the prevailing situation, echoing other sources who say Chinese feed mills are buying corn hand-to-mouth as prices drop.
"And for American farmers -- they must love the Chinese government," he said.
International trading companies are rebelling against a contractual stipulation by Chinese traders demanding the right to reinspect and reject some cargoes arriving in China, traders said on Wednesday.
"No way, there is absolutely no reason for any trading company to accept these terms," a Singapore grain trader said.
Chinese companies named by trading sources were unavailable to comment on reports the new contracts gave them the right to re-inspect soybean and soybean meal cargoes on their own terms.
Those terms allowed the Chinese buyer to inspect the cargo once it arrived at a Chinese port, even though it had already passed inspection before leaving for China, another trader said.
Ostensibly, the terms were to protect the buyer in case a quarantinable bug or disease was found in the cargo -- such as TCK smut, which affects wheat and is barred from China.
But traders were concerned the new terms could exposure them to further risk if some buyers used them as an excuse to renege on deals as prices dropped.
Traders polled by Reuters said their companies were refusing to accept the new contracts.
"They are taking positions themselves," a veteran trader said of the Chinese trading houses involved. "And you are always increasing your risk in dealing with speculative buyers."
China has bought between 1.5 million and two million tonnes of soybeans and soybean meal in the past three months, traders said. Much of it is being loaded or is on the way and due to arrive in China before year-end.
Prices have fallen dramatically, especially since China's October 1 National Day holiday, after which most orders came. Since then, Asian traders have been on tenterhooks awaiting letters of credit from the Chinese buyers guaranteeing payment.
Earlier, soybean cargoes were purchased above US$300 a tonne. Chicago Board of Trade November soybean futures closed on Tuesday at $6.70 a bushel, or $263 a tonne.
Some Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation in recent years for reneging on deals if the price of the commodity they are buying drops between the order and the delivery.
Few Asian traders have reported washed-out deals since the price decline began.
But some said the re-inspection terms, which began appearing on contracts in the past two or three weeks, could be attempts by the Chinese buyers to squeeze discounts out of the sellers.
International trading companies have previously been stung when Beijing's food trading arm, China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO) altered contractual terms.
In May, COFCO informed the trading companies that they would have to bear responsiblity for the rejected cargo and all costs if TCK smut was found on wheat shipments arriving in China,
Traders in Asia said they refused to do business with China on those terms and the matter was dropped.
"After the TCK debacle, we're not willing to take any risks. It's not the way international trade is done," one source said.

Genetically-altered soybeans at the centre of an international environmental furore are causing little concern in China, a major soybean importer with its own bio-engineering programmes, industry sources said on Wednesday.
"China is a very public and vocal supporter of our technology," said a source at Monsanto Co, the developer of the first genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
"The Chinese have been heavily involved in their own programmes to produce insect-resistant cotton and genetically-altered soybeans, corn and rice," the source in Hong Kong, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Monsanto has been targeted in the United States and now in Europe by environmental groups opposed to genetic engineering.
The soybeans have been developed with a resistance to a widely-used weed killer called Roundup, also a Monsanto product.
"I would think they would be very happy in China to get their hands on some of this product if they are pest-resistant," an industry executive in China said.
"They have a lot of their own problems with insects, especially in their soy and corn crops," he said.  
The Monsanto source said Chinese research, while a good decade behind his own company's, mirrored Monsanto's efforts at developing pest and insecticide resistant crops.
"So I wouldn't expect there to be any concern in China about this product," he said.
He said Monsanto was negotiating for co-operative projects in China, but would not give further details.
Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners were preparing on Tuesday to picket the arrival in Hamburg of a ship believed to be carrying some of the Monsanto soybeans.
Greenpeace activists in Hong Kong, however, said on Wednesday that despite concerns, they had no plan to campaign against the sale of the genetically-altered beans in Asia.
"The problem is we don't know what form it is in -- in powder form, in animal feed, mixed into hamburger meat -- so we have no way of knowing if we are eating it," said Clement Chan, spokesman for Greenpeace in Hong Kong.
"The beans have not been extensively tested before being made available to the public so we don't know what we are doing to human or animal bodies," he said.
Other than providing information on request, Greenpeace had no plan of action against the beans in Asia, Chan said.  
The beans have been approved for use in Japan, the biggest buyer of U.S. soybean products, the Monsanto source said.
User-groups in other countries, such as the Food and Drink Industry Association of the Netherlands, have also said they will use the genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
Grain traders and industry executives in Asia said they had received no expression of concern from potential buyers in the region about the altered soybeans and did not expect to.
"They represent a very small proportion of the U.S. crop at this stage," a grain trader in Singapore said, adding the beans could account for 10 percent of the total U.S. crop in 1997.
The U.S. soybean crop, now more than 70 percent harvested, is expected to be more than 64 million tonnes, according to the American Soybean Association. Of that, 24.8 million tonnes will go to export markets.
While not among the biggest customers for U.S. soybean products, China is expected to buy around one million tonnes of beans in calendar 1996, and up to two million tonnes of meal.

Wheat is unlikely to become a casualty of the row between Beijing and Washington over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since higher grain production in China is slashing the need for imports, traders said on Tuesday.
"As far as we see business, we could well not have anything with China for the rest of this year," a U.S. trader said.
"The (Chinese) domestic crop looks good, they have cancelled a lot of orders already. Canada has enough to hold China if they do need to get into the market," she said.
China's 1996/97 wheat production was expected to hit a record 107 million tonnes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said ealier this month, raising its estimate from 104 million tonnes.
As a result, total imports were also revised downward by one million tonnes to eight million tonnes.
A new war of words broke out between Beijing and Washington this month after the Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy missiles and other weaponry worth around US$420 million.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.  
China has demanded the United States cancel plans for these latest arms sales to prevent "new damage" to bilateral ties.

While some trading sources have speculated that the cancellations could be in retaliation for stalled bilateral negotiations over a fungus called tilletia controversa kuhn, or TCK smut, others put them down to the good Chinese crop outlook.

None of this has deterred U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman from his optimism that China will remain a committed buyer of U.S. wheat.
"I think the key issue myself with China is supplies in China," Glickman said in Chicago on Monday.  
"The Chinese have pulled their grain purchases to some degree, but I do not perceive that we will see China out of the U.S. market. I think they will be in the market, but I can't tell you for how much," he said after a fund-raising meeting of the Congressional Hunger Center.
The United States was not the "preferred" supplier of wheat to China, he said, and the two countries had issues to resolve. He expressed concern that problems such as TCK smut could be used as trade barriers.
China does not accept wheat from the U.S. Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of the fungus, which it fears could spread through its own wheat crop and cut yields.
Washington claims officially that TCK is harmless, though quarantine officials have said privately that it can indeed cut yields and that treatments are ineffective.
China imported 11.59 million tonnes of wheat in 1995, up 58.7 percent from the 7.3 million tonnes the year before.
U.S. wheat accounted for 3.8 million tonnes of the 1995 total, U.S. figures show.
Canadian and Australian sales of malting barley to China could be limited by weather woes and disease concerns, which are cutting the amount of quality grain available for export this year, industry sources said on Monday.
Canada was hit by early snow that damaged the barley crop and would keep sales to China of the higher quality malting variety below 300,000 tonnes, a Canadian marketing source said.
Canada had already sold close to 300,000 tonnes of malting barley to China in the current marketing year (August-July), he told Reuters.
"We won't do more than 300,000 tonnes (to China)," he said. "We will be lucky if we hit 300,000. It's a very tight market."
That tightness could work to Australia's advantage, but farmers there had shown a preference this year for disease-resistant strains of feed barley, Barry Marshall, deputy general manager of the Australian Barley Board (ABB), said.
Frost in Victoria and South Australia could cut the board's availability of malting barley by 100,000 tonnes from earlier expectations of 920,000 from the two southern states, Marshall said by telephone from his Adelaide office.
The ABB, which markets Victorian and South Australian barley, could thus have 400,000 tonnes of malting barley to sell domestically and the same again for export.
"We would hope 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes will go to China," Marshall said.
Official Chinese figures show total barley imports from January to September 1996 were 959,138 tonnes, and 37,267 tonnes in September alone. No comparative figures were available.
Australia's total crop would be in the range of 6.03 million tonnes, Marshall said, up from last year's 5.5 million and possibly the best ever.
The harvest should begin in about 10 days, he said, and exports could start moving in early December.
Canada's shipments of two-row malting barley to China last marketing year were around 400,000 tonnes, selling at around US$240 a tonne, the marketing source in Hong Kong said.
He said Canadian wheat began the marketing year to China at around $230 a tonne C&amp;F China, after the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO) agreed on the price.
"The CWB is trying to compete because the Australians have such a large crop," he said.
The ABB's Marshall said Australian malting barley was US$194-195 FOB Australian ports, arriving C&amp;F China at about US$220 a tonne.
Earlier sales went for around $200 a tonne FOB, he said, adding that Canada's earlier FOB prices were around $210.
China's beer market is one of the most dynamic in the world, with 1995 year-on-year growth of 10.8 percent for total output of 15.46 million tonnes, according to official figures.
China produced 13.71 million tonnes of beer in the first nine months of 1996, up 5.45 percent on the year-ago period, State Statistical Bureau figures show.
China grows around four million tonnes of barley each year but little of malting quality.
Canada's exports of malting barley to China have averaged 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes a year in recent years.
Australia and the European Union share much of the remainder of the market, though Australia was out of the trading loop in 1994 because drought cut barley output to 2.4 million tonnes.

Chinese grain sellers are cutting the price they are willing to accept to export corn but are still a good US$12 a tonne over prevailing world prices, Far East trading sources said on Wednesday.
Chinese corn was being offered at $150 a tonne FOB (free on board), traders in Hong Kong and China said, while U.S. corn is selling into Asian ports at $138 c&amp;f (cost and freight) a tonne.
"There is no point because no one is going to pay that price," said a trader in Hong Kong.
He said Chinese sellers could be coming under pressure to move old crop as the new crop -- expected to be a bumper of between 115 million and 120 million tonnes -- comes on stream.
Traders who bought corn earlier in 1996 in the hope of making huge profits had been paying storage costs for more than six months and could now be trying to cut their losses, he said.
An industry source in Beijing said the offers were being made by state-owned traders in Jilin and Heilongjiang, China's major corn-growing provinces in the far northeast.
"At 1,250 (yuan per tonne, or $150) there won't be any takers unless China starts selling forward -- March, April, May -- which would see them possibly being more competitive," he said.
Wednesday's March futures price on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was 1,550 yuan ($186) per tonne.
Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) fell in Tuesday trading after the release of official U.S. figures predicting an enormous U.S. corn crop.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the 1996 crop would total 9.265 million bushels, far above previous estimates. The announcement pushed December corn down 1/4 cents to $2.68 and March down 1-1/4 cents to $2.70-1/2.
Asian traders said they expected U.S. corn to fall further in the immediate term, leaving Chinese corn in its dust.
Traders reported last week that China had already given the green light to corn exports -- lifting a ban in effect since December 1994 -- but authorities had set a minimum price of $170 a tonne when the world price was $140-150.
Trading sources said they were receiving offers from provincial branches of Beijing's central food buying arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO) and some Chinese trading companies with export permits.
The general feeling among traders polled by Reuters was that the price had been set with the intention of stifling exports.
Permission had to come from vice premier and economic tsar Zhu Rongji, who would be loathe to take any steps that could be inflationary, said industry sources who have met with Zhu over the issue.
With U.S. corn prices seen falling -- one Hong Kong trader predicted $130 a tonne c&amp;f Asian ports -- industry sources doubted any Chinese corn would leave home within the next six months.

Around 300,000 tonnes of copper is in the process of being added to the stocks of China's central reserve authorities with about a third of that quantity now clearing through customs, Asian traders said on Monday.
Metals trading and industry sources polled in recent days by Reuters generally agreed that Shanghai bonded warehouses have held up to 100,000 tonnes of copper.
"The copper in the Shanghai (bonded) warehouses has been settled and is moving into China," a Chinese metals trader said.  
The copper's ownership and purpose have been contentious since it was channelled into China in the wake of Japanese Sumitomo Corp's revelation in June of massive copper-trading losses now said by the company to total US$2.6 billion.
Many market and industry sources have said the copper was bought by Beijing's metals trading arm China National Non-ferrous Metals Import/Export Corp (CNIEC) possibily in conjunction with Sumitomo.
Neither CNIEC nor Sumitomo have made any official comment.  
A Chinese source, who trades for a state-owned company, said central authorities bought the copper now moving through customs to cover the 85,000 tonnes of the red metal lent to the market in March 1995 and which had to be taken back.
But a European trader in Beijing said the 85,000 tonnes was additional to the tonnages now undergoing customs formalities.
He also noted the earlier movement of between 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of copper which was shipped from Shanghai to bonded warehouses in north China for the state reserve.  
Another 50,000-60,000 tonnes had been taken from London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses and would be delivered to Chinese ports in January or early February, he said.
The European source's total figure of 285,000-295,000 tonnes tallies with reports from other sources, Western and Chinese, who have said China, either through major state-owned trading companies or smaller firms with hot money, is due to take delivery of substantial amounts of copper.
As the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price plummeted in June on Sumitomo's news, China was said to be taking advantage of prices below $2,000 a tonne to stock up.  
Arbitrage opportunities are narrowing, however, and trade sources said they were relieved the Shanghai hoard was destined for central government reserves.
"This will keep it off the market," a Shanghai trader said.
The European source in Beijing said: "These tonnages are worth US$1 billion and only the central reserve authorities have the capacity to put out this sort of money.
"It could even be part of the Three Gorges Dam budget -- that project could easily use 100,000 tonnes of copper and the reserve's stocks are very low," he said.  
A large gap between LME and Shanghai Metal Exchange prices gave Chinese arbitragers a stab at healthy profits and a chance to take their money out of domestic equities.
This fuelled fears that massive amounts of copper could be channeled onto the domestic Chinese market.
A South American source who regularly visits Chinese copper smelters said many of his contacts had recently expressed fears that 300,000 tonnes of copper would soon arrive in China and kill the market for domestic product.  
Beijing's plan to dam the Yangtse River is one of the world's biggest infrastructure projects, costing around $30 billion and due for completion in 2009.
Five different departments of Shanghai Customs contacted by Reuters said they did not know of the copper movements.
A number of government departments, as well as Beijing's metals production arm China National Non-ferrous Metals Corp (CNNC) and CNIEC also said they were not aware of or had no comment on the market talk.
China is traditionally guarded about its reserves, treating all relevant figures as a state secret.  
Copper futures on the Shanghai Metal Exchange breached the key resistance level of 20,000 yuan ($2,409) per tonne in early Monday trading, after sharp gains on the LME on Friday.
LME copper rode a roller-coaster on Friday, finally settling at $2,148 a tonne, a gain of $117 over Thursday as the market shook off rumours of huge stocks held in Rotterdam and focused on the lowest LME copper stocks in 6-1/4 years.

Some Chinese traders are moving to take advantage of a sharp rally in world copper prices by selling the red metal back to the market, Far East metal industry sources said on Wednesday.
A rise in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore was attributed in part by some trading sources to Chinese selling.
"With such high LME prices, I believe some (copper) will be brought out of China," a Singapore trader said.  
He said stocks in Singapore rose 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes late last week -- after hovering at extremely low levels for the past couple of months -- as Chinese buyers sold material recently taken from LME warehouses elsewhere.
Asian traders have said China is adding substantial tonnages -- up to 300,000 tonnes -- to its central stockpile, with a third of that amount now passing through customs in Shanghai.
These reports have helped fuel a rally in three-month LME copper, which has climbed almost 20 percent in recent weeks on tight physical supply.  
Three-month LME metal hit a five-month high of $2,232 a tonne on Tuesday, up from $1,900 at the end of October.
Whether or not the copper now in China has completed customs formalities is not an issue, sources said.
"This is the government, they do what they like," said one.
There was a feeling, however, that Chinese government departments, mired in bureaucratic red tape, would be unable to move fast enough to take advantage of rapid market movements.
This would be the province of minor trading companies using hot money to buy small lots for speculative purposes.  
At least one Asian trader reported small parcel offerings from Chinese companies wanting to pick up between $200-$300 a tonne in profit.
Prices are at their highest since June 14 when Japan's Sumitomo Corp announced that one of its copper traders had wracked up losses in unauthorised deals now said by the company to be US$2.6 billion.
Reports from Europe last week of a hidden hoard of 600,000 tonnes of copper in Rotterdam were shot down by Asian traders.  
Tight global supply is now driving prices, with LME copper stocks below 100,000 tonnes for the first time since 1990 and representing less than a month's demand.
Traders in the Far East, polled in recent days, told Reuters this fundamental shift in the world supply/demand picture should keep prices buoyed at least in the short term.
"It's a volatile market and it is impossible to know what is going to happen," a South American source said.
"Is it going to stay over $1/lb next year? Absolutely, I have no doubt about that. It won't be for a couple of days, I'm talking for maybe a quarter and I think it will then stay there.  
"Why? Consumption. Don't forget consumption. It is much more important than people think. The fundamentals really call for a higher price," he said.
Shanghai and surrounding areas alone use upwards of 45,000 tonnes of copper a month, a European source in Hong Kong said.
But physical copper on the Shanghai Metal Exchange has also been tight as traders there liquidate their positions on the rising LME prices.
"Prices have gone up so fast it is a little bit hard to digest," a trader in Shanghai said.
"It could be beneficial to export," she said.  
"On the other hand, anyone who wanted to buy could be afraid the price will start to go the other way. It's close to year-end, book-squaring time, so everyone will want to sit back and wait."

Copper stored in Shanghai warehouses -- the murky ownership of which has cast a pall of concern over the world market -- is being offered in small lots to European trading houses, industry sources said on Thursday.
The copper is been offered for sale at a high premium in order to set a benchmark price for its eventual sale to China's strategic stockpile, one Chinese trader said.
Traders said that estimates of copper reserves brought into China in recent months range between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes. A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.
CNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.
The copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996. "They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it," a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.
Traders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.
In March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.
But when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.
Not so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: "Who owns it is anyone's guess."
The metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.
Three month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.
"It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss," a trader said.
"Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them," the Chinese trader said.
"But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage."
A trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would "dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic".
But the Chinese source said: "This copper can only be taken by the stockpile" because no other buyer could afford it.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.
Freight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.
Other traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.
About 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses. This has not been confirmed.
Another 20,000 tonnes of copper was stored in Shanghai Metal Exchange warehouses in the eastern port city, and the remainder of the metal was in other Shanghai stores, traders said.
"The whole market is still being manipulated by somebody," a Chinese source said. "The game is not over."
Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of copper have moved through Chinese customs into central stocks and are staying put, despite fears the metal could be sold to take advantage of current high prices, traders said on Monday.
"It was a good decision to buy good quality metal at 85 to 90 (U.S.) cents a pound; now they are feeling smug," a South American industry executive said of China's central authorities.
"It is central buying, there is no doubt about that because none of it is moving out," he said.
China recently boosted central copper reserves by 300,000 tonnes, with most of it now having cleared customs formalities, although a lag in Chinese customs reporting may keep the figures off the books for a couple of months, trading sources said.
Few Chinese trading companies would have the financial resources to buy and then store substantial amounts of copper, a Shanghai trader said.
The recent surge in world spot prices had been expected to fuel a flow of Chinese material on to the world market.
But a modest rise last week in stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore -- traders said about 3,000 tonnes -- indicated the Chinese material was staying home.
"It's a piddling amount," a trader in Hong Kong said of the increase in stocks in Singapore.
LME copper trading has been volatile in recent weeks, with a moderate rise in stocks on Friday, the first since early September, pushing prices down on profit-taking and liquidation.
Three months copper finished Friday at US$2,242, bouncing off support around $2,220 in the afternoon ring, dealers said.
Losses were kept to a minimum, they said, as market jitters centred on the upcoming December options declaration. The main concern was if December copper came close to $2,600, where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls.
With LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50, the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $2,600, which total 168,750 tonnes.
Traders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling.
What little movement there has been out of China, some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore, was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, the Shanghai trader said.
While China was neither actively buying nor selling now, it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year, traders said.
"The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers," a marketing executive with a major producer said.
He said China's crackdown on scrap imports, coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters, would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes.
The opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996, he said.
Official customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995, to 549,571 tonnes, with October imports 82,655 tonnes.
The new smelter, a joint venture between Tongling and Japan's Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year, the marketing executive said.
"They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate, and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal," he said.
In other base metal markets, premiums to Hong Kong remained largely unchanged. The latest Hong Kong indications of premium or discount in US$/tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis:

Protectionist policies practised by a major Chinese soybean producing province are keeping prices for the grain throughout the country artifically high, Far East traders said on Thursday.
Heilongjiang, in China's far northeast, will not allow soybeans to leave the province in any but value-added form, a policy which traders said had been enforced for three years.
"This means the bean price is being kept artificially low in Heilongjiang and artificially high in other provinces," a trader in Hong Kong said.
Despite the recent arrival on the market of a soybean crop of between 10 and 12 million tonnes, domestic prices had not fallen, trade and industry sources said.
Heilongjiang grows one-third of China's annual soybean crop.
Officials there confirmed to Reuters in September that the "policy of appropriate control", which traders characterise as a ban on sale of beans outside the province, would stay in place.
The policy aimed to meet demand from local crushing mills, which crush the beans to produce oil and meal, an official said by telephone from the provincial capital of Harbin.
But China's crushing industry is not concentrated in Heilongjiang, and traders said crushers in other regions were having to pay inflated prices for their raw material.
The National Grains and Oils Information Centre in Shanghai reported on Wednesday that grade three beans in Heilongjiang were fetching 2,840 yuan (US$342) a tonne.
By contrast, beans elsewhere were priced at up to 3,320 yuan a tonne.
Traders with western companies in the region agreed with these figures, saying beans smuggled out of Heilongjiang were commanding a hefty premium.
"Outside the province (Heilongjiang), there is a premium of 100 or 200 renminbi (yuan) a tonne for smuggling the beans," another trader said.
"There are road blocks in Heilongjiang to checks loads on trucks, people even use post office trucks to carry beans -- and they've been caught," he said.
"It is costing other provinces more money for beans."
Another industry executive said the price of domestically produced soybean meal, used to make animal feed, had also remained high despite the recent soybean harvest.
"Prices for meal are not coming down, they are still 2,900 to 3,100 renminbi per tonne," he said, levels that have prevailed for some months.
High soybean meal prices would in turn lead to high meat prices, the executive said, adding his organisation believed pork prices in China's coastal areas had risen 20 percent in the past two to three months as a result.
This year's soybean crop had been expected to drop two to three percent on the 1995 figure of 13 million tonnes, said traders who toured growing regions.
Heilongjiang's output was 4.3 million tonnes in 1995.
Traders and industry experts who visited the province in September put output there this year at 3.5 to four million tonnes.
One industry expert based in Shanghai said China's soybean supply shortfall would be 2.5 million tonnes in the coming year.
China's total soybean imports for 1996 should be around one million tonnes, traders said.

China has missed a golden opportunity to export corn and earn millions of dollars, and now has up to a million tonnes of the grain rotting in silos in the country's north, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
"This year is going to be a major disaster," a Hong Kong trader said.
"All that corn sitting in Dalian is just rotting," he said, adding his estimate that 500,000 to one million tonnes of corn was stored in northern silos in anticipation of exports.
Corn, grown predominantly in China's far northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, began moving to northern ports, particularly Dalian, around May, traders said.
"People had geared up for a huge export programme and I think the traditional northeast suppliers anticipated two million tonnes being permissioned for export," a trader in Singapore said.
Concern about national food security and the impact on domestic prices that exports would have in an atmosphere of acute inflationary paranoia had kept China out of the world corn market, trading sources said.
Corn and rice exports were banned in December 1994 after stocks fell to frighteningly low levels in a country where the governing Communist Party bases much of its ruling mandate on availability and affordability of staple foods.
Imports soon began, totalling 5.18 million tonnes in 1995. Corn imports in the first five months of 1996 were 400,000 tonnes, customs figures show.
Expectations began building in April that China's central grain authorities would allow corn exports to take advantage of high world prices and also to ease a local surplus and push up softening domestic prices. Prices had dropped below $120 a tonne in some areas.
Word at the time from traders involved in negotiations with China's central grain reserve on what nature the exports should take -- barter or cash -- was that the corn would be sold mostly to Japan and South Korea at around $180 a tonne.
"There was a stage when they could have got $180, and from the inverse they could have picked up $20 a tonne selling FOB (free on board) and picking up from the U.S. six months later," the Singapore trader said. "They missed a big opportunity."
A few hundred thousand tonnes of Chinese corn was sold to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, or bartered for equipment supplied by Japanese food processing corporations as part of joint-venture deals, industry sources said.
China's government, however, remained adamant that the export ban had not been lifted.
Officials of the newly-established Jilin Grain Group, set up by the Jilin provincial government and opened for business on Monday, told Reuters the province had its biggest stockpile in history, some three million tonnes.
The company was applying for the right to import and export corn "in order to solve the problem of huge corn stockpiles," an official of the company said.
Official figures put 1995 corn production at 101 million tonnes. Output in 1996 has been projected by media to hit 112 million tonnes. Annual demand is 100-115 million tonnes.
Traders and grain industry sources have said China's total corn reserves are up to 30 million tonnes.
Traders said that while owners of the corn stocked at northern ports such as Dalian, Yingkou and Qinghuangdao had lost money on transport, storage and deterioration, the grain was now slowly being absorbed back into the domestic market.
Copper is dribbling out of China in small lots as some Chinese traders try to take advantage of higher world prices to cash in, Far East metals traders said on Monday.
In an otherwise catatonic market, copper movements out of China were the only ripples on a glassy pond.
"The market is very dull, but we are getting some calls from people asking us to help them ship to LME (London Metal Exchange) warehouses in Singapore," said the manager of a state-owned Chinese metals trading firm in Hong Kong.
"They bought the metal a long time ago and pretty cheap, and they want to take advantage of the higher LME market now."
The Chinese selling was in small lots only, nothing more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, as small-time traders sought to liquidate, square the books for year-end and fill their pockets with some much-needed cash, traders said.
The copper market has been abuzz with little more than Chinese copper movements in recent months as the red metal has plied the waters between Shanghai and Singapore and back again.
Movements in stock levels in LME warehouses in Singapore have been attributed to Chinese buying and selling, though movement out has been to Chinese central reserves and in small lots, metals industry sources said.
Copper prices on the LME closed easier on Friday after a half-hearted rally based on some short-covering.
Traders and analysts said early in London's Monday that copper prices were likely to fall towards support at US$2,120 a tonne, after Friday's close of $2,162/64.
In the zinc market, prices could climb to as high as $1,200 a tonne in the first half of 1997, a Hong Kong trader said.
A fall last week in LME zinc stocks had caused some concern, she said, as metal buyers have long been used to picking up material when they need it and at long stable prices.
Figures released on Friday show a drawdown in stocks of 3,050 tonnes -- not an unhealthy level -- to 523,925 tonnes. Some liquidation was seen in Friday trading, with the price ending $17 a tonne easier at $1,048.
News that Spain's Austriana de Zinc liquidated its entire zinc futures position on the LME, announced in mid-November, had been absorbed by the market, she said, adding that the move was important for its value as information rather than its impact.
Nevertheless, she said, "the information scared the market".
"Manufacturers are saying they will be looking at levels of $1,200 in the first quarter, possibly the first half (of 1997)," she said.
China's zinc alloy business was the best bet, she said, adding that she had locked in long-term contracts and was looking forward to a happy and prosperous 1997 as the dye-casting industry in southern China thrived.
Aluminium remained dead, traders said, as Chinese consumers turned to domestic stocks rather than imports to meet their meagre needs.
A narrow differential between LME and Shanghai Metal Exchange prices made imports unworkable and could keep China off the world market until after Chinese New Year in February.
"I'm looking for higher domestic aluminium prices," a trader with a European firm said.
LME aluminium closed at $1,526 a tonne on Friday. The Shanghai December price ended last week at 13,480 yuan ($1,667).
"Imported aluminium must pay nine percent duty and 17 percent VAT (value-added tax) -- though of course people don't pay that. And even without paying it and you just have the price and the premium, they still cannot afford to import," the trader said.
"We are getting no inquiries from extruders," said another source recently returned from China's Hainan Island.
"They are getting domestic material. As they use up domestic stocks, this could lead to a demand next year -- we are praying every day for that," said another trader. "Otherwise, it's going to be a long and quiet holiday."

China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday.
No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.
"As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out," said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.
China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected.
This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.
Rice imports could not go ahead without central government approval, and the process of issuing quotas and licences could take weeks or even months, trading sources said.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said at the weekend that flooding in Hunan, one of China's major rice-growing provinces, had prevented farmers from planting rice for the autumn harvest and could force them to depend on food aid until next summer.
"Many farmers lost the season's first crop of rice in the floods and were unable to plant for the second harvest, leaving them dependent on food aid until their next crop, in one year's time," said Thorir Gudmundsson.
"For the second crop, they need to plant in July, and it is now mid-August," he said.
The notion that China might need to import rice to meet demand provided some underlying support to rice futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Monday.
The CBOT September price closed up 5-1/2 U.S. cents per cwt at $10.16.
Chicago rice futures have been underpinned by a recent U.S. report that China bought 20,000 tonnes of Vietnamese white rice for prompt July shipments and that additional purchases were expected.
But very little movement in domestic Chinese rice prices has been seen over the past three months, traders said.
"To be convinced that China will buy some rice, I have to get confirmation from the market -- but so far the market has not done anything, prices are steady," one Asian trader said.
Traders in China quoted domestic prices at 2,200-2,300 yuan ($265-$277) a tonne for low quality long grain rice; 2,600-2,700 yuan ($313-$325) for high quality long grain rice; up to 2,800 yuan ($337) for low quality short grain rice; and 3,000 yuan ($361) for high quality short grain rice.
More than 500 people were killed by the July floods in Hunan alone, with the national death toll from floods and typhoons surpassing 2,700, according to the government.
Applications for rice imports would have to traverse China's multi-layered bureaucracy, trading sources said, though the procedure could be speeded up in times of emergency.
The State Planning Commission (SPC) would issue a national quota, which would then be allocated to provincial SPC offices, which would then distribute the quota to trading companies, trading sources said.
Rice, along with wheat, corn and soybeans, is considered a strategic grain and is thus tightly regulated.
Hunan grows more than 22 percent of China's total early rice crop. Losses to the rice crop in the central province have been estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, accounting for most of the 2.6 million tonnes of Hunan's total grain losses.
About 90 percent of China's early rice crop of 50 million tonnes is grown in Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. China has three rice crops a year.
A Chinese analyst predicted earlier this month that the flooding could cut early rice output by between 10 and 20 percent. This would reduce the total 1996 rice crop by up to four percent for a total output figure of about 180 million tonnes.
China's rice production in 1995 was 179 million tonnes according to figures from the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.
China's ban on poultry imports from two U.S. states, aimed at preventing a deadly epidemic, is unlikely to be mired in the politics of Beijing's bid to join the World Trade Organisation, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.
"They (Chinese authorities) are very sensitive to any sort of disease profile," Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, told Reuters.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and the State Bureau of Animal Plant and Quarantine said the ban on poultry products from Oklahoma and Missouri went into effect on Monday.
Official news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two rural states because five cases of a deadly poultry flu were discovered between July and September.
China's Xinhua news agency described this virus, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, as an "extremely harmful contagious epidemic disease". Holloway agreed. "It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases," he said. "The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die."
But Holloway said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.
The U.S. embassy in Beijing issued a statement confirming the Chinese ban but would not elaborate. Other U.S. agricultural officials were not immediately available for comment.
Some U.S. industry sources suggested the ban could be connected with Beijing's tit-for-tat trade disputes with Washington and timed to coincide with the first ministerial meeting of the 128-member World Trade Organisation in Singapore.
But Holloway said this was unlikely.
The last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, he said.
The poultry industries of Oklahoma and Missouri were far down on the list of top U.S. producers and exporters, he said.
"My estimate is that Oklahoma and Missouri account for less than five percent of U.S. poultry exports to China," he said.
Arkansas is the country's biggest poultry producer and home of industry giant Tyson Foods Inc.
A source at Tyson's Hong Kong office said VVND was known to exist in China, but this could not be confirmed.
The United States exports around US$500 million of poultry and poultry products a year to China, its biggest market after Russia.
Canada reported one case of VVND, found in a wild cormorant, in October, a Canadian embassy official in Beijing said.
Under existing protocols between Ottawa and Beijing, Canadian poultry exports to China did not cease, and neither volume nor value was affected, the embassy source said.
But all Canadian poultry must be now certified as not coming from the area where the dead bird was found, he said.
The current Chinese ban comes only weeks after the resolution of another dispute that saw Beijing ban all U.S. poultry imports because of fears they carried highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI.
U.S. officials said Chinese authorities had mistaken HPAI for the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI. The United States flew in experts to meet with Chinese officials.
That ban was lifted before being implemented.

Shanghai-born tycoon Tung Chee-hwa claimed victory for himself and for the Chinese nation on Wednesday when he won the race for Hong Kong's future leader.
"For the past 100 years, Hong Kong has been a colony. Now we are in charge of ourselves. I believe most Hong Kong people have confidence in the future," said Tung.
"Some people still have worries, but I want to remind them that people walk the road together, success lies with the people and comes from their efforts," he said.
"I believe everyone should be clear that we want a better Hong Kong, a better future," Tung said.
Tung was elected by the Selection Committee, a panel of 400 members handpicked by Beijing, to be Hong Kong's Chief Executive once the colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.
In a short, prepared victory speech, Tung, 59, stressed pragmatism and stability and downplayed democracy.
While noting Hong Kong's rule of law, spirit of freedom and strong civil service, Tung said it was important to secure a smooth transition for the colony from British to Chinese rule.
"I believe we can do better than before, based on the one country-two systems policy and under the protection of the Basic Law," Tung said.
He was referring to Beijing's policy for letting Hong Kong's capitalist system continue after it comes under the communist government's jurisidiction, and to its post-1997 constitution.
That Tung would be the man to take on Hong Kong's leadership yoke after the departure of the last British governor, Chris Patten, had been widely seen as a foregone conclusion.
The shipping magnate heads a family empire that was bailed out of financial difficulties by China a decade ago.
In the first round of voting by the 400-member Selection Committee, Tung took 206 votes. On Wednesday, he won 320 votes.
His speech was delivered at Hong Kong's Convention Centre immediately after his victory was declared by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who said Tung had become Hong Kong's most democratically elected leader to date.
The voting process, long criticised as undemocratic and unrepresentative of Hong Kong's six million people, was a step forward on the colony's road to democracy, Tung said.
"People may have differing opinions about the pace of democratic change in Hong Kong, but today, under the Basic Law, I believe we are making the first step towards democracy and this is most suitable for Hong Kong's situation," Tung said.
"This is a good start," he said. "Today we elect our own chief executive and in the future, we will follow the Basic Law and the actual situation of our society, step by step, to push democracy forward," he said.
He called on Hong Kong's political parties not to politicise issues but to work together for the sake of their country and for all Chinese people.
Demonstrations were part of Hong Kong culture, he said, but people should instead sit down and discuss their grievances.
Tung emphasised public welfare reform and called for a long-term re-examination of education, welfare for the elderly and industry policy.
He was leaving for Shenzhen, a Chinese special economic zone on Hong Kong's border, later on Wednesday, where he was expected to receive China's official blessing as Hong Kong's next leader.
U.S. experts are striving to assure China their chicken is safe, but it is impossible to tell if poultry exported to China comes from areas hit by dangerous diseases, government and industry sources said on Monday.
Poultry is processed on such a massive scale in the United States there was no way of knowing where the birds originated, a U.S. agriculture expert told Reuters.
"So it would be impossible to identify in a shipment of meat from Arkansas which chickens came from Oklahoma or Missouri," the expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
A senior U.S. diplomatic source said, however, poultry shipments could be certified as not having come from regions where quarantinable diseases were an issue.
U.S. poultry exports to China, worth around US$500 million a year, were hit by a disease scare last week when the Chinese press reported a ban on poultry from Oklahoma and Missouri.
Chinese quarantine officials confirmed the ban, linking it to a deadly poultry flu called viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease or VVND, discovered in the two states during the summer.  
A Chinese quarantine official in Beijing said he was aware of U.S. claims the disease had been confined to pet birds, but said the ban would stand.
The Chinese official contradicted U.S. sources by saying there were no plans to hold bilateral talks on the issue.
A U.S. source told Reuters he met with Chinese quarantine officials on Monday morning.
"They know it is not of real consequence," he said, adding that talks were slated to take place on this and other agricultural issues in California in late January.
The diplomatic source said banning poultry from those two states would be like banning pineapples from Beijing.
"Pineapples don't come from Beijing and chicken does not come to China from Oklahoma and Missouri," the source said.
Missouri and Oklahoma together produce less than five percent of the total U.S. poultry output, said Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department.
The disease was found in parrots imported from Mexico for sale in Oklahoma pet shops, Holloway said.  
Federal U.S. veterinarians eradicated the birds and all trace of the disease, he said, adding that it had no contact with commercial flocks.
VVND kills all birds that come into contact with it, and necessitates the eradication of entire commercial flocks.
It is carried principally by psittaciformes -- parrots, parakeets, budgerigars and macaws, Holloway said.
Parrots introduced the disease into California in the 1970s, leading to the destruction of the state's entire poultry flock.
Gus Schumacher, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agriculture Service, said U.S. experts were working to reassure Chinese quarantine officials the disease had no effect on U.S. poultry.
"It is not at all linked to American poultry so we're reassuring the Chinese quarantine officials and working through this in an explanatory, technical way, so the trade will continue on an active basis," he said.
Schumacher, in Hong Kong last Friday, said chickens were not now being shipped to China from these two states, but trade from other areas of the U.S. had not been affected.  
However, cheap land and labour in the two rural states was attracting contract production from major producers that pay for labour and feed, and then purchase all chicks produced, the agriculture expert said.
"Most of the birds produced in these two states are shipped elsewhere for processing, like Arkansas or Mississippi...so it is generic chicken and there is no way to tell," he said.
Demand is the engine that will drive China's metals markets in 1997, said analysts and traders who expect a modest flow of money to keep consumption of base metals such as aluminium and copper ticking over.
"Consumption, don't forget consumption. It is much more important than people think," a South American industry executive told Reuters.
"The fundamentals really call for a higher price," he said of copper.  
While some trading and production firms are convinced an increase in total worldwide copper production capacity could lead to a supply glut after the first quarter of 1997, and a subsequent price spike, the Chilean source disagreed.
Buoyant global demand should ensure copper prices stay above the "magic US$1 a lb figure" for a good part of the year, he said, adding that Chinese consumption would make up an important proportion of the total.  
A senior metal trader in Shanghai said the city's metal futures exchange was becoming more reflective of real underlying fundamentals in the country's base metal market and reducing the opportunity to arbitrage between cash and futures prices.
"If they (traders) don't think (copper) imports are necessary, the (futures) price will stay low, but if consumption needs pick up, the exchange price will go up," she said.
Arbitraging had been a feature of the Shanghai exchange in 1996, the Shanghai trading source said.  
"It looks like there will be efforts to control arbitraging (in 1997) -- though if the demand is there and stock is low, then the price will go up anyway," she said.
The Shanghai Metal Exchange had enough copper stocks to see end-users through to Chinese New Year in February, she said.
Daryl Ho, senior economist in Hong Kong with Jardine Fleming Asia Research, said the effects of Beijing's easing of credit restrictions would be seen more clearly in 1997 as money began filtering through to such sectors as construction.  
Traders have complained since mid-1996 that a near-halt to construction throughout China, based on a lack of available cash to keep projects going, has stifled metals use and purchasing.
This slowdown would be reflected in China's overall 1996 economic growth figure, expected to come in at eight to nine percent after 10.2 percent in 1995, an aluminium trader said.
"Eight to 10 percent growth for 1996 is a beautiful rate for Europe, but China is looking at having had 13 percent in recent years, so it is a setback," he said.
"We think it is a healthy setback, setting the scene for more stable growth and it is quite encouraging."  
Aluminium in China had bucked the year's international trend of de-stocking -- one that will see the rest of the world's end-users, having run down their stockpiles, re-stocking in 1997 -- much to the delight of producers.
China's official figures would probably show aluminium imports for 1996 at around 400,000 tonnes, the trader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
"But I think a lot of that has to do with cargoes delayed from 1995 and that actual net imports will be around 300,000 tonnes," not much changed from 1995, he said.  
And for 1997? "We see no change in the pattern in 1997, China will be pretty much business as usual," he said.
Jardine Fleming's Ho said the easier availability of money might not translate immediately into higher base metal imports as extra domestic production had to be absorbed first.
The main sticking point for the industry in 1997 and beyond will be how the government deals with the myriad state enterprises that continue to bleed cash.
The state-owned enterprises were effectively shouldering the government's social welfare burden, Ho said.  
The metals industry provides some startling examples of this excess, with smelters and factories employing in some cases hundreds of thousands of people, subsidising for them everything from housing and schooling to health care and food.
At the same time, Ho said, management had no incentive to work for profit "so money keeps flowing out of the government's pockets".
"It is not an impossible problem to solve if the government can encourage the development of the private sector -- and that's a slow process," Ho said.  
China's communist leaders are anxious to avoid the problems of unemployment and bankruptcy that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and now plague Russia's attempts at reform.
A German source saw these problems of over-employment and under-performance as the metal industry's Nemesis.
"Look at the zinc smelters -- a total disaster. They are all bankrupt. This is just a big black hole, overstaffed, totally overstaffed -- which is also a result of the system," he said on condition of anonymity.  
"It's all the system -- look at Russia, look at East Germany, they all had the same problem," he said, echoing many other traders and industry executives polled by Reuters.
He cited the example of China Steel in Taiwan, which produces 5.65 million tonnes a year of crude steel with 13,000 employees.
Compare these figures to one of China's biggest steel producers, Baotou Iron and Steel in Inner Mongolia, which employs 160,000 people for annual crude steel output of just four million tonnes.  
"This is such a classic example, it tells you everything. This is China's problem. And it will only get worse," he said.
Problems of corruption and inefficiency aside, it is a rare international metals company that feels it can afford not to be in China.
"China is becoming a more important market," the Chilean source said.
"For instance, in 1992/93 only 200,000 tonnes of (copper) concentrate was being imported. Now it is double and I don't see this trend stopping any time," he said.

China's zinc industry is fast succumbing to the rigours of reform, as mines and smelters find that surviving without government grace is difficult and the ways of the world are tough, Far East traders said on Monday.
Withdrawal of government subsidies, combined with tight credit, expensive infrastructure and utilties, and over-manned mines and smelters mean the industry is struggling to compete.
Chinese zinc exports have slowed as Chinese sellers are unwilling to lower their prices to world levels, traders said.
"The Chinese are asking high premiums -- LME (London Metal Exchange) plus US$70 to Hong Kong and Taiwan," one said.
Three month LME zinc was quoted at $1,036/$1,038 a tonne in early trade on Monday up slightly from Friday's $1,033 close.
Many Asian customers bought zinc heavily in late 1995 and still have stock to consume before they look to China, a Hong Kong trader said.
Nor is China importing much zinc, as a 10 percent import duty and a value-added tax of 17 percent made it too expensive for cash-starved smelters, traders said.
July customs figures show China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys dropped to 117,293 tonnes in the first seven months of 1996, down 7.1 percent on the same year-ago period.
The January-May export figure of 86,494 tonnes was down 25.5 percent on the corresponding period in 1995.
An executive with an Australian firm said the problems faced by the Chinese industry would take a long time to resolve.
Expansions planned some years ago had not been costed on world terms, he said, but on the local supply of raw materials that were sold at a set price.
So when mine depletion and rising demand became evident and forced China to look outside for raw materials, "they found it was very expensive, much more expensive than they expected."
As China's economy has grown at about 10 percent a year, zinc consumption is maintaining a growth rate of about eight percent, the Commodities Research Unit (CRU) said in a report.
Zinc output has risen faster than consumption and enabled China to become a net exporter of about 200,000 tonnes of slab in 1995 -- after being an importer 10 years earlier of 200,000 tonnes, CRU figures show.
U.K.-based CRU put China's 1994 mine output at 949,000 tonnes of zinc.
China's influence on the world market is expected to continue, despite reduced exports, an analyst at Billiton Metals in London said in July.
China's refined zinc exports in 1995 totalled 164,000 tonnes, compared with 222,000 tonnes in 1994, the analyst, Karen Norton said. London brokers T Hoare &amp; Co put China's average yearly exports in the previous five years at 70,000 tonnes.
The Chinese government is gradually withdrawing subsidies to mines and smelters in line with requirements for membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), trading sources said.
"The zinc price is down, but the Chinese are getting a double whammy with subsidies disappearing," the Australian source said.
"They can't lay people off, but they have to make money -- so what can they do?" he said.
"The real issue is that the smelters have to become competitive, and this means redundancies... So even though they are free to run the smelters as free enterprises, it would be a brave man to be the first to stick his hand up and say he is going to lay off a couple of thousand workers."
Capacity in China will remain under-utilised, while expansion elsewhere will further pressure the industry.
"The Chinese will have to compete, and their competitors will be leaner and meaner," the Australian source said.
While China's leaders peppered 1996 with assurances they can attain their Holy Grail of feeding a fifth of the global population on a tiny patch of its arable land, outside China the calls for a reality check grow louder.
Grain and oilseed production is increasing, but the economics of China's agricultural sector remain patchy and official figures can sometimes leave much to the imagination.
As a result, Western analysts and grain industry leaders are sceptical about China's ability to achieve its stated goal of grain self-sufficiency.
Many industry sources say China's communist leadership must overcome its need to keep state grain reserves secret and give the world notice of its growing food needs.
"They should get it together on real need, announce it and let other growing nations know and plan and grow for supply to China," said a consultant to the Chinese and U.S. grain industries.
"If it becomes apparent that China is importing, you'll see Argentina, Brazil gearing up to meet demand, the U.S. will expand, India might try... so there'll be competition for the China market -- which should in turn act to stabilise prices," he said on condition of anonymity.
Official projections that 1996 grain output will be yet another record, hitting 485 million tonnes after 1995's bumper 465 million tonnes, are "high even for ministry officials," says China Agribusiness, an analytical newsletter published in Hong Kong by China Concept Investment (BVI) Ltd.
"Increased domestic supply has reduced import needs, and could cause (domestic) prices to fall and 1997 production to suffer," the newsletter's third quarter 1996 issue says.
Grain supply has grown in China by 55 million tonnes in the past two years. The government predicts it will grow to 550 million tonnes a year by 2010, to feed a population which will expand from the current 1.2 billion to more than 1.4 billion.
China's net grain imports in the first nine months of 1996 were 7.4 million tonnes, with industry experts expecting total imports for the year to total eight to nine million tonnes.
This is well down on 1995's imports of around 17 million tonnes, mostly on the back of the bumper harvests, a ban on some grain exports, and a conscious official effort over the past couple of years to boost strategic grain reserves.
This has brought a much-needed confidence boost, coming after alarming predictions by American environmentalist Lester Brown that China's rising population and diminishing land and water resources will lead to enormous grain import needs.
"There's a bit more confidence on the part of China now," a grain industry executive based in Beijing with a U.S. organisation said in a recent interview.
"More than two years after Lester Brown came up with his scare-mongering, a lot of people (in China) are looking at these last two years as evidence that 'We can feed China, that's who'," he told Reuters by telephone from Beijing.
"The more realistic people here are saying imports will be a significant part of China's needs, that perhaps five to 10 percent of needs will be covered by imports annually," he said. Like other observers of China's agriculture sector, he sees 1997's grain imports falling significantly.
The Chinese government said in a recent agriculture policy white paper that grain imports could be limited to five percent of need over the coming 35 years.
Indeed, China has already frozen wheat import permits for next year because of an expected bumper crop.
Corn is in such oversupply in the northeastern growing regions that questions are being asked about how the crop, currently under harvest, be stored -- though exports, banned since December 1994, could help.
The one problem China seems unable to deal with is that of price stability.
Chinese farmers, long permitted to grow what they choose, will plant what they think will bring them the most money. With little or no planning, this leads to famine-and-feast cycles.
the coming year, 1997, will be no exception. With corn exports banned and a bumper crop on the way, corn is heading for oversupply that will push prices down.
This will in turn discourage farmers from planting corn next year, instead looking for a crop that will bring them a profit -- probably soybeans, the current short-supply crop.
"The danger -- and one that Chinese people just cannot get through their heads -- is if there is a domestic switch from corn to soy, the soy price will drop on higher supply, farmers will then stop growing soy, corn will go up in price on tighter supply and the whole boom-bust cycle begins again," a senior marketer of U.S. grains to China said.
He says China is heading for a 2.5 million-tonne soybeans shortfall in 1997 because just a couple of years ago soybeans were in oversupply, prices dropped and farmers headed for corn.
What would help?
China Agribusiness suggests the current high-supply period could be a good time to reform the grain price system, bringing the government's procurement price -- that paid for a set quota of each farmer's grain -- and the higher market price into line.
The grain marketer and others advocate a continuation of the current import policies, based on need, and an end to the secrecy that keeps the world guessing.
"Looking at it from the point of view of announcing state reserves, it would definitely help China," he said, though he pointed to the fears among China's communist leadership of panic buying and hoarding if reserves were low.
Without more openness, expert sources say, the world has no way of knowing if China will need as much as Lester Brown says -- 369 million tonnes of grain imports a year by 2030.
Or if, as the Chinese Agriculture Ministry's white paper says, import needs will be kept below 40 million tonnes by then as technology brings greater production efficiency, the population peaks and dependence on grain as a staple diminishes.

China is awash with steel and suppliers scrambling for a piece of one of the world's few active markets and keeping prices down while they go about it, traders and industry executives in Asia said on Tuesday. "The competition is forcing prices down," a senior executive with a Western firm said.
Prices had fallen 10 percent and more over the past couple of months, an executive with a Japanese steelmaker said.
Cold-rolled steel was fetching between $400 and $430 a tonne, he said, galvanized steel up to $100 less than that.  
He and other sources repeated reports of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of galvanized steel stacked up at Chinese ports, but these could not be confirmed.
Steel industry figures said China was flooded with cheap steel, much of it from the former Soviet Union, and most gave a pessimistic outlook for the recovery of the Chinese market.
"I can't see the bottom yet," the Japanese executive said. "People have been hoping for a recovery, but I think there is no hope for improvement within this year."  
Figures published in the official Chinese press in July showed imports of steel billet and rolled steel in the first five months of 1995 at 6.83 million tonnes, up 18.9 percent on the same 1995 period.
Exports of these products were down 31.8 percent, to 2.59 million tonnes, in the January-May period, press reports said.
A flood into Asia of European steel makers fleeing soft markets at home has increased the choice of quality products in China five-fold, the Western source said.  
Steel stockpiles that had been mounting since the phenomenal buying of 1993 -- when 33 million tonnes of steel entered the country -- were slowly being whittled away, traders said.
Total 1994 imports were 22 million tonnes. In 1995, they were 15 million.
Jason Zheng, senior China and regional steel analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said he estimated China's steel stockpile at 30 million tonnes.
The quality was unknown but doubtful, he said, and so should not dent China's need for high quality product.  
China would probably import between 12 and 15 million tonnes of steel in 1996, trade and industry sources said.
"What they need is a quality they can't get at home," the Western executive said.
Imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were falling, Zheng said, "because it is low quality stuff and if you only have 12 to 15 million tonnes of imports, you must have a higher quality product coming in".
However, industry sources said China's steel market was weak and beset by a lack of cash for buyers -- and a rising incidence of contract washouts.  
"Buyers are not willing to pay for their orders, not just because they don't have the cash, but because the price drops between order and delivery time and they are rejecting the cargoes or asking us to reduce the price," the Japanese executive said
A source with another Japanese steelmaker said major Japanese mills had cut their prices by 10 to 15 percent to hold on to their Chinese customers.
"So the obvious trend is that demand is not growing as the Japanese mills had expected and as a result they have a lot of surplus to push onto the market," he said.  
"The problem is that even though China's state-owned manufacturers are trying to produce more, they are having problems getting hard currency to buy the raw materials."
China's annual steel demand was around 95 million tonnes, trading sources said.
China's Ministry of Metallurgical Industry said in July that steel demand would reach an annual 120 million tonnes by 2000.
The Ministry set an annual output target of 130 million tonnes by 2000, and said production would increase by five million tonnes a year between 1996 and 2000.
